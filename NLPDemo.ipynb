From College Humor   Tennagers guide to picking a AIM screen name  Whether you\\'re sending e-mails or chatting with friends, an essential to using the internet is having a screen name that tells people who you are. Here are some suggestions to help you pick out an awesome name!   AE or AF - Use these acronyms for American Eagle and Abercrombie and Fitch. This will show people that you have rich parents and therefore, you are rich as well. And everyone knows that if you are rich and wear Abercrombie and Fitch, then you are very attractive.   Examples: AE_girl04, AF_snowboard19   420 - Putting 420 after a screen name will show people that you are rebellious and are cool because you do drugs. They won\\'t ever mess with you, and girls will flock to you because you are bad.   Examples: Sublimegirl420, sk8er420   69 - This shows that you obviously have sex, A LOT. Others that see this will want to have sex with you because you know all about it.   Examples: Sexystud69, badazz6969   666 - Use this to scare away people. They will see how mighty and evil you are, and they will fallback in fear.   Examples: Death666, NeoMatrix666  \"chic\" - Guys are very attracted to girls who but \"chic\" somewhere in their screen name. This shows you are hot and want to have a boyfriend who likes to play computer games all day and collect Star Wars toys.   Example: tightchic13f, cute_chic02   \"sexy\" - Guys go crazy when you put on this screen name. It says \"I\\'m a really attractive girl that wants to have sex with a guy I meet online.\" You can be uglier than Chelsea Clinton, but with this on your SN, you\\'ll come across as Brittany Spears.   Examples: Sexy18f, Sexyskatergirl   \"gurl\" - Using \"gurl\" in your screen name shows that you are the cute girl that lives next door type. It makes you sound very nice, but also a target of weird 40-year old sexual predators.   Examples: fun_gurl_2003, pony_gurl82   \"horny\" - This shows that you are a 40-year old sexual predator that wants to find a young boy or girl to lure in and abduct at the local mall.   Examples: Horny_babe_696969, Horny4u',\n",

       " 'Live From Ohio, It\\'s Youth Night!     So, the Youth Rally was tonight. I think it was a success. Maybe not. We expected 200 or more kids from different youth groups all throughout Ohio, but only 149 were in attendance. We started with the skit, which I\\'ll get into a little later, then the activity, then we ate, sang discordantly, and had a sermon. The sermon was great, done by a Mr. James Hawkins, future missionary to Spain. The singing was bad and not from the heart, then again we wing it when we do sing at Youth Rallies. The eating was good, and there was a lot of extra pizza and soda, some of which I brought home due to excess amounts. The activity looked complicated and confusing, but luckily, Tim and I didn\\'t have to do it -- instead, we got to make sure others were doing it right. And finally, the skit...  It was genius, or something close to genius. The whole activity was basically a spy thing: aptly named \"Mission Possible,\" I won\\'t explain the rules because they were complicated, but everyone was on a mission using their Bibles to stop sinful things like bitterness and laziness by looking up verses talking about each. Well, the opening skit went like this: I, in a shirt and tie and carrying a briefcase with a cell phone on my belt, started walking down the main aisle of the church. Halfway down the aisle (it\\'s a small church) the phone rang; I answered it, had a one-sided conversation (\"Yes, I have received the instructions... yes, we will be rendevouzing at the church tonight...\" etc.), then proceeded to the front of the church. I laid down the briefcase on a table and started a conversation with Tim (who played \"Agent Banks\"). Following the few short lines we exchanged, I pulled out a tape, set it in the tape player, and turned it on; one of my teachers then, over the microphone, acted as the tape and explained the mission. She said it would self destruct in ten seconds, so I pulled it out, fumbled it around, dropped it a couple times, then dropped it back into the briefcase. There was a piece of flash paper resting on some foil near the top; I took out a candle lighter and lit it to make it look like an explosion. Then we exchanged two more lines and prayed, and it was over.  At least, that was what was SUPPOSED to happen. And for the most part, it did. But at the part where I was supposed to light the paper, the candle lighter decided that it didn\\'t want to work. So here I am, holding the dumb thing and pressing the button -- click, click, click -- and there was supposed to be a self destruction. Finally it worked, and there was a flash of fire, then we went on.  Next order of business: I hate ProHosting. I set up the YDKJ forum (check the links) on free.prohosting.com, because they offer unlimited bandwidth for no price. Now I get an email saying that they want a one-time $10 membership fee to remove the ads. So I need a credit card and I have to pay $10 once in order to have an ad-less forum. I don\\'t even *want* the ads gone, but I don\\'t have a choice. It\\'s pay or wave goodbye to your account. I\\'m upset about this, and emailed them saying that they need an option to keep the ads for people that don\\'t want to pay, but the stuck-up woman simply replied \"we\\'ve offered free hosting for years. Please continue to support free.prohosting.com.\" Grr, it makes me so mad... anyhow, I posted at the forum, asking if somebody with a credit card was willing to contribute through PayPal. No luck so far, though. If I don\\'t get it paid in fourteen days -- well, thirteen, since I got the letter yesterday -- then the account is deactivated. Thirty days, and it\\'s deleted forever. So... what\\'s a guy to do?  Okay, I\\'m about done for tonight with my ranting and all. I\\'ll post again tomorrow night, same time, same place. Oh, by the way: Priscilla complained to me and whined that I didn\\'t put her into the blog, so I say: Priscilla is a girl. There, I mentioned you! Happiness! Good night.',\n",
       " \"This Tape will Self-Destruct...     Hello again, friends and strangers. Time to make another page in the chronicle of Blog Blog Blog Blog.  Today was an okay day. I practiced more for the skit at tomorrow's Youth Rally. Tim and I really aren't prepared at all... we got barely any time to practice our lines, and only have a bare understanding of the core of what we're doing. Luckily, we're allowed to improvise, since it's only a short three minute skit. I want it to be a surprise for those who have yet to see it, so I'll post up the results of what happended tomorrow night. It is REALLY cool, and if it wasn't serious, would leave a lot of room for comical mischief. (All those that don't care, say aye.) Anyhow, we have maybe an hour and a half of rehearsal under our belts, so luckily it isn't TOO important, and the job we have to do will be done easily.  Dad picked me up today from school, and we went to my favorite toy store -- Best Buy. I need a new hard drive for my computer, so we took a look at what they had to offer; I expected to walk away with a 60-gig 7200RPM hard drive, but they didn't have any, and even if they did, we found a better deal. For about $20 more (after rebate) I found a 100gb hard drive. As soon as Dad gets paid, he's gonna grab it and bring it over to me. I can't wait. Right now I'm running a 7-gig... the new one will be nearly  fifteen times larger  than what I have. I've had this harddrive since 1997/98 when it came with the computer, and it's about high time I grab a new one. I'm giddy. Now all I need to keep my computer as up-to-date as possible will be a new motherboard and a new processor (400mhz isn't quite sufficient anymore, especially to a multitasker who uses Kazaa, Flash 4, and sometimes RPGMaker2000 at the same time.)  Ben Folds is amazing. I just watched his limited edition live DVD last night for the first time... he completely turned around Song for the Dumped from an upbeat song to a sadder song with a slower tempo and a different tune, plus he added a lot of extra stuff. I've never had the privilege to see Mr. Folds live, but the DVD proves that seeing a life show would be simply awesome. (Army was cool, too, I love the audience interaction.)  That's about all I have to say, so I'll close with this: HUZZAH, FINAL FANTASY X-2! Farewell.\",\n",
       " 'Judgment Day     Today was a day I like to call the Day of Reckoning, or Judgment Day, or Happy Chainsaw Thursday, if you choose. First, foremost, and most important to me,  I passed my Biblical Ethics test today!  I scored a 94%. That had to be the toughest test I\\'ve ever taken -- the questions were hard, but, if I failed, I would have basically let my Pastor down, so there was an added sense of urgency. But I didn\\'t fail, I passed! Yeeee!  Otherwise, Kevin was expelled today. The dummy got what was coming to him. Finally, after the supervisors and Pastor have been putting up with his crap for a long time, they dismissed him. A sad thing indeed, but I have no remorse whatsoever for their actions. He promised the school in a formal statement that he wouldn\\'t participate in immoral and un-Christian things. Yet he did anyway. He got so many chances to change himself, and I mean a lot of chances -- even after the Pastor found out that he smokes and after many, many disciplinary efforts, he still got more chances to change. They believed in him, and he threw it all away. What a dummy.  And so I refer to today as \"Judgment Day,\" the day that futures were decided. I kept up the work and devotion to God, and he kept up his wrongful ways and his misbehavior, and now the good Lord made some changes... I passed the test and earned the Pastor\\'s and the supervisors\\' respect, and he lost it all. Pity...  So... Happy Chainsaw Thursday. I passed, he left. I\\'m happy, he\\'s in big trouble with his life. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; in this case, well, both.

I came home and have to study for a big Biblical Ethics test. NERVOUS!  I'm almost through with the Biblical Ethics course, I finished the eleventh lesson today and will test tomorrow. I'm scared out of my dress shoes. I've learned a lot from the course, though; as much as it took away from my mornings for the past two weeks, it's been real helpful in teaching me how to deal with life and how to live happily. God is spiffy. Anyhow, I have a lot to study, because I do NOT want to fail something like this.  Oh, and Edmund Randolph was in George Washington's cabinet. (Washington decided to save him for later so he stored him in there for safe keeping.) Dumb statement, but that was the main thing I forgot on my American History test today.

Finally, after several emails to and from each other, he emailed me and said, \"Look, why don\\'t you call me instead of all this slow email? It\\'ll be easier.\" So, I reluctantly (yeah, right) landed a phone call to Jellyvision HQ, Chicago. My dumb voice cracked twice... Puberty\\'s been and gone, maybe my larynx\\'ll catch up to me someday. Anyhow, we spoke for sixteen minutes, discussing the board and chatting about Jellyvision and the hosts of YDKJ and all. It was a grand old time.  So much to catch up on... well, business first. Adam, Jellyvision\\'s tech guy, asked me to port all the crap from the current board to a brand spankin\\' spiffy new account. I downloaded it all, and... well, let\\'s just say, headache. Here\\'s an excerpt of my letter to Adam last night at 3.   I downloaded all the files directly from the current account into a folder on my hard drive, and downloaded both the Perl and CGI versions of the YaBB source code (partly as a source for default files, and partly since the newest version contains security patches). I uploaded everything from the old board into the new account directly (making sure to upload everything in ASCII as per the instructions) to cgi-bin/YaBB/ and tried to run it; I get a 500 Internal Server Error from ProHosting. I messed with a few of the files, reinstalling the defaults of files that could\\'ve gotten accidentally changed or corrupted, and tried again; nothing. I created a different folder -- this time named \"yabb\" instead of \"YaBB\" -- and decided to try installing the entire system all over again with the CGI version. I uploaded everything in accordance to what I remember from my experience with installing YaBB before, and tried to run it. Once again, it didn\\'t work, so I decided to give the Perl version a try, and made one last folder -- \"forum\" -- and followed the instructions exactly. Figuring from the footer on the error messages I was getting, I assume that it\\'s a Unix server and requires chmoding of the files, so I chmoded each file as the instructions requested, and after I had done everything just as it was asking me to do, I tested YaBB.pl and got the same vicious error message. I went to the unofficial free.prohosting.com FAQ to see if they had anything to say about my problem with the scripts, and I found instructions to chmod each file differently than what the YaBB instructions asked, because \"that\\'s how Prohosting works.\"   Shew! What a load of garbage. Oh well. I posted at the yabb support forum. All should be well, if I ever get a reply.

Well, one part specifically: \"I\\'m hot blooded, check it and see -- I\\'ve got a fever of a hundred and three.\"  Yes, guys and gals, for the past three or four days I\\'ve been sick with some kind of flu or something. Tuesday night, I came home from my aunt\\'s house and felt my head burning. I took my temperature, and clocked in at 99 point something... great. I felt like I was gonna throw up. Luckily, it\\'s Friday night and I\\'m happy to announce that my face has not hugged the toilet bowl. However, it  has  hugged the ice pack.  Wednesday I had no school, my teacher\\'s mother-in-law died and since it\\'s a really small school and everyone\\'s close to each other they called it off Wednesday due to her funeral. I wasn\\'t feeling too bad Wednesday afternoon and all, and Wednesday night wasn\\'t too bad aside from my eyes starting to burn.  Now we shuffle along to Thursday morning. I sat up and asked Mom if I could stay home since I\\'d been feeling a bit under the weather. She decided to try and get the best of me and said that the only way I\\'d be kept home is with a temperature of 100. She didn\\'t think that would happen. I shoved the thermometer under my tongue and waited for the woman inside to announce my temperature. Okay, so I cheated a little -- I looked at the digital screen and saw my temperature in advance, but nonetheless I pulled it out of my mouth at 100.5. I was happy -- no school! Mom didn\\'t really know what to say, but it WAS over 100 and thus I stayed home.  It was cool that I was staying home... until I awoke again two hours later. I spent all morning and afternoon in my bed, mostly watching SNL reruns (Alec Baldwin is awfully unfunny) and stand up comedy on Comedy Central. At three, I started surfing the channels looking for something else to watch. I turned on Montel Williams. Rape victims convict a serial rapist -- the topic caught my attention (no, I\\'m not some freak that\\'s turned on by rape; I just love hearing about people bringing a criminal to justice) and that occupied my screen till 4. By that time, my eyes were burning up and watering like a broken faucet, so I rested my head and tried sleeping. Mom returned from the store and I took my temperature. I felt lovely after hearing the tinny woman in the thermometer announce my body temperature -- 102.3. Mom gave me an ice pack for my burning head and I tried sleeping. Somewhere in there, the temperature climbed to 102.6. Mom called the doctor and asked for her advice. The doctor advised her to give me some Motrin. I took the medicine at 5:30 and by 6:30 I was up and out of bed. I ate (veal parmesian, yum!) and got onto the computer. My fever had managed to drop to 98.8 -- joy. Time passed. At 11:45 I got offline and took my temperature. It was back up to 101. I ended up taking two more Motrin pills at 12:45 or so and tried watching two of the final three episodes of Cheers. I fell asleep at 1:45.  Woke up. Friday. I wasn\\'t going to school. I relaxed in bed for a while; turned on the TV and watched more standup comedy. I don\\'t really remember what all happened today, aside from playing Metroid Fusion and eating chicken-broccoli soup. I took more Motrin at 3:30 and got out of bed at 4:30.

Metroid Zero Mission\\'s gonna be spiffy, by the way. Cheerio.',\n",
       " 'Urgh... times infinity.     Current Song: \"Yesterday,\" The Beatles     Yes, I already used this song a few entries ago. But you know what? It kind of fits.  Saturday was wonderful. I installed a DSL router and we picked up a wireless card for my laptop, so I could plug the ethernet cable on into the router and have a split connection, the PC and the Laptop both online at once. It was COOL. The wireless connection rocked, it gave me hardly any problems and was a sinch to set up. I was up till five in the morning, just talking away, surfing, using the internet from my room.  Then Sunday struck. And when Sunday struck, \"Yesterday\" came into play. \"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away... now it looks as though they\\'re here to stay.\"  Sunday morning, I woke up, and guess what. The DSL light on my modem -- off! Yes, boys and girls, my DSL just stopped working. I spent most of Sunday fooling with wires, talking with technical support, scolding my modem, everything... it just didn\\'t work. The DSL light would flicker, and sometimes it would stay on for two minutes, sometimes five minutes, sometimes it wouldn\\'t even find a connection at all. Eventually, I deducted (yes, deducted -- not deduced, deducted) that something was wrong with the phone line, seeing as our phone was really staticy, but I wasn\\'t sure.  *Click, click* Monday! I came home from school, and the DSL light was ON. Yes! It worked! For about fifteen minutes, that is. Then it flickered, and came back on within fifteen seconds. That\\'s the story of yesterday. I\\'d be online for a nice chunk of time, then get kicked, and then get on, then kicked, and eventually it started kicking me into submission and I couldn\\'t even get online. That\\'s yesterday.  *Click, click* Fast forward to today. I come home from school... nothing. The power light was on, but the others were all off. No signal what-so-ever. And to top it off, our phone didn\\'t work. It would be on for half a minute, with a bunch of static, then I\\'d get a dial tone. That was definately from the phone line, so I was right that it\\'s giving us trouble... it\\'s just too coincedential to not be the phone line. The phone problems and DSL problems started at the same time. Not that it matters anymore, though, because after watching the modem do absolutely nothing, then turning it off and on and watching it malfunction a bit, I called technical support. Guess what? My DSL modem is dead. Shot. No more. Down the drain. Kaploosh.  We\\'re at a decision point. Either we sort out the many, many problems with the DSL, get a new modem, and then go through more trouble later... or, we kill the DSL bit and switch to Adelphia PowerLink Cable. I\\'d like to keep the DSL, because I don\\'t wanna change my email address and I get 700mb or so of web space that I need to house files for my website. However, I am TIRED, sick and tired, of putting up with it! I want to get something that works. DSL was fine for a year, no problems whatsoever, nice speed, etc. But when the problems started hitting, they weren\\'t minor problems, they all had a huge payload that threw me into a boat somewhere in the middle of Lake Erie and ran off with the paddle. So, I don\\'t wanna put up with it anymore. Unfortunately, until we get things sorted, I have no broadband connection... but I have a solution.  While we get everything all together with what ISP we use, I\\'m going to sign up for a free trial of AOL. LUCKILY, my laptop came with a 56k modem, so I popped that in, threw in a phone cable, installed AOL, and got online using my uncle\\'s screenname. (Sorry, it was my only choice... besides, you guys were in bed when I got on anyway!) That\\'s where I am right now... on AOL. Tomorrow I intend on going for a free trial, so I can at least correspond with the world while we work on getting together broadband. Ahh well. That\\'s my entry... huge as it is. That\\'s my last couple of days. Aie...  OH! BUT BEFORE I GO! LUCASARTS RELEASED A TRAILER FOR SAM AND MAX: FREELANCE POLICE, THEIR NEW SNM GAME!!! WAA-diddily-HAAHAAA!! ...anyway. Yeah. Go watch it.

       " \"'Could it be? Could it really, truly be?'     Current Song: [Space Quest Four MIDI soundtrack]     We may have isolated the problem. Every time it's rained since we got the router two weeks ago, the DSL's been killed. The first time, Brad the Tech Guy came out and solved our problems. Until it rained again. Then the DSL was killed. That would be my last entry, 5/20.  Well, two nights ago, my youth minister suggested I unplug our cordless phone from the wall and see what happens, if it was fixed. So yesterday, I unplugged our cordless. After about an hour and a half, the DSL was stable. So today, I plugged it back in after school. After an hour and a half or so, while it drizzled a bit, the DSL flickered back out. I unplugged it. Hour and a half later, it came back. And that's where I am now. It seems that the cordless phone is our problem... however, it's supposed to rain more this weekend. We're going to keep the phone unplugged and if the DSL goes out when it rains, then the phone isn't the problem.. but as it seems right now, the phone is the problem. At least, the phone jack could be it... I don't know. But I seem to be back online now... I keep watching the modem to see if I lose the connection. Hasn't dropped it yet, and as of this writing, it's been on for half an hour. Well, thirty five minutes.  So, we'll see.\",\n",

It stormed again, and now that it stormed my DSL flickers in and out. I\\'m back on Dialup... AGAIN... and I hate it...  Is it so bad for me to have a working connection?  Gah... well, I have this AOL trial until June 20 or so, so it\\'ll be available until Steve comes to visit. Around there, at least.

It\\'s now 11:43, so it\\'s been solid for the past eight hours and forty three minutes... except that fluke. What do I make of this? It\\'s not the phone that\\'s the problem. It\\'s OBVIOUSLY the wiring, and since Brad the Tech Guy fixed our wiring -- not to mention the fact that our phones and the phone upstairs in my aunt\\'s house is screwy -- it\\'s most likely outside the house. On the phone with Jessie earlier, it was kinda staticy. The DSL isn\\'t following a pattern as to how it shuts down... it just stays on or doesn\\'t. I managed a few games of Starcraft with Mewd earlier, too. I have no doubt that it\\'ll flicker off again. But for now, it\\'s okay... and the phone works and all... so... yeah.

       " '2004, I likes you already     Current Song: \"Brain Damage,\" Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Much happier     See? See? 2004 fi... fi... repaired my laptop problem. (Sorry, a certain key of mine coming betwen z and c is not working at the moment.)  It was a stupid solution. A VERY stupid solution. I\\'d done everything I usually did to correct the problem. You know what I had to do? I had to remove the battery while it was booted. That\\'s right. While it was booted. And it worked like a charm.  Well, almost. Because now, after much knocking around of my computer to try and knock some sense into it, I guess I have a stuck key. See, it\\'s weird. My... my... you know what, lemme copy and paste something here... x There. My x key doesn\\'t work. In order to type the letter, I have to have it on the clipboard and paste it in when I need it. I don\\'t know why. Furthermore, when I boot the computer, I get a tidal wave of beeps cursed at me from the speakers. After fiddling around, hitting random keys, the stuck key finally gives way or something. Also, for some odd, odd reason, I can\\'t make a capital S or W with the right shift key. If I hold both the shift key and the letter down, then release the shift key, then the letter is typed in a bold, capital flavor. But ONLY then. Every other key works fine with the right shift. S and W work just like regular with the left shift. What gives?  Ah well. Enough about that. At least the laptop works again. I didn\\'t lose anything, thank God.  I\\'ve decided that I\\'m tired of leading a life of purely digital entertainment. It\\'s great, really, but you know, I haven\\'t read through a book in the LONGEST time. This is all going to change. Today, I picked up the one-volume edition of The Lord of the Rings that I\\'ve had in my desk for two years and started to read it. Let\\'s get one thing straight right off the bat -- I\\'m not a fan of LOTR. I don\\'t hate it, either. I don\\'t have any feelings for it. I\\'ve seen the first two movies, the second half-heartedly, and remember neither of them. I\\'ve always wanted to read the books, but, let\\'s face it, I have trouble reading. For as much as I love writing, I have trouble reading books. I read words just fine. I don\\'t have any kind of deficiency or anything. I just have trouble picturing things in books. I\\'m trying hard to get over that. I think it\\'s because I try to picture what the author pictures and fail miserably, instead of issuing every character and place its own characteristics according to my imagination.  I\\'m trying to do more of that imagining stuff. So, I\\'m reading LOTR for three reasons: 1, because I\\'m tired of feeling like an idiot and saying that I have trouble reading the books. B, because I want to read the books and all. And III, because I\\'m  tired of people watching the movies then claiming to be fans because it\\'s trendy.   Honestly, face it! LOTR is trendy now. It\\'s popular, it\\'s up there. Something once reserved to geeks is now a nationwide phenomenon. I don\\'t have a problem with fantasy or LOTR or geekhood at all, mind you, but it\\'s stupid how people are getting into it just so they can fit in. The movies are great. They\\'re epic, they\\'re detailed, the acting is great, the fantasy comes to life. I don\\'t have a problem with the movies. Get that out of your head right now: I have nothing wrong with LOTR. And I don\\'t have anything wrong with people who watch the movies and become fans through those movies. But many people I know are only into it because their friends are. They claim to be fans, but it\\'s only a front so people will like them. This is why I want to read the books. Before I get into the movies, I want to read the books. It\\'s an American stereotype to watch the movie instead of the book, and I don\\'t want to fall into that stereotype. Movies are wonderful, but they shouldn\\'t replace the book they\\'re based on. In my humble opinion, before you go spouting off about how huge of a fan you are of the LOTR series, you have to have at LEAST a DESIRE to read the books. Josh is a big LOTR fan, but he hasn\\'t read the books. However, he WANTS to read the books. That\\'s an entirely different story. If you\\'re going to be a fan, be a fan of the whole thing, and not just the movie because the movie is trendy and all of your friends like it!  ...huff, huff...  ...I\\'m going back to reading.',\n",

Now, this has happened. Often. And when it does, I just unplug it, take out the battery, then put both power sources back in and reboot it.  Not this time.  The laptop no longer turns on. The light\\'sll go on and the hard drive will start to creak, but that\\'s the end of it. Monitor never even turns on. I don\\'t know why. Judging from the circumstances, it doesn\\'t look like a virus or anything. For one, this has happened before, just... not for quite this long. Two, this happened because of my hitting the switch. I think it might just be because the computer is a bit overheated -- I always put it in suspend and never in shut-down, and just restart when I have to. Else, I don\\'t know. I have the battery out and the power unplugged. I\\'ll plug it back in later.  At the end of November, I had to reformat thanks to a software problem in which my sound poofed away. As such, I have everything from April 26th up till November 26th saved. 800mb of backup on the PC. Unfortunately, everything from November 26th up \\'till now is gone. My SNES ROM collection, for instance. Oh, and  my website.  Yeah, that\\'s gone too. Not to mention my progress in Riven and GK2, and countless other trinkets I\\'ve downloaded since. Remember that save file I never told you about where I had almost beaten Zero Wing in Round Three? Gone. This is a major letdown.  No, can\\'t let that mindframe get a hold of me.

Jessie left to take a shower, and the whole time I just stared at her IM, waiting for her to come back, while listening to Dark Side of the Moon. I tried to pull myself away, but I just kept staring... and staring... and staring... and... augh! I got depressed! Help! Help! Getitoff!  Anyway, I didn\\'t start this entry to write that. I came to write about 2003.  First off, the obligatory paragraph entitled \"Where Did the Time Go (I\\'m Getting Old)\" that starts these kinds of posts.   Where Did the Time Go (I\\'m Getting Old)   Well? Where DID it go? You know, 2003\\'s been awfully funny. It seems like the year zipped by. I feel like I just took down the Christmas tree at the end of last Christmas. I feel like my dad just married my stepmom. I feel like I just had that sixteenth birthday party. I feel like I just saw my uncle at the Super Bowl party two months ago. And yet, at the same time, I feel like 2003 shouldn\\'t be ending. Seriously. I feel like it\\'s been 2003 for ages, and that it shouldn\\'t change just yet. Why? I don\\'t know. That\\'s why I\\'m ranting about it. This year feels so funky.  Now, on to the meat of the blog entry:   What a freakin\\' year.   Lessee... 2003. What all happened? Well, my dad got married to my stepmom in Februrary. I turned sixteen in April. I got my domain name (mwahaha). Well, first I moved to ShadowOnline. THEN I left it and got my domain name. I had a job, for three weeks, then I got fired. Steve came to visit for a few days and put me to shame in Smash Bros. Melee. And most importantly, on June 23rd, Jessie and I started dating. It\\'s been six months since we started now... wow. THAT shot by, fast. Hmm. Really fast.  Well, we\\'re about to head out to dinner at the Olive Garden now. I still have to write a letter to Jessie telling her that I might not be on till later.

At 9:20 or so, tragedy struck: a stinkin' search page screwed over Internet Explorer. I couldn't visit any websites -- anything I'd stuff into my Address bar would be disregarded and instead would take me to the same search page. I virus-scanned. I ad-awared twice. I reinstalled IE6. I mucked about in the registry. At 10:30-ish, I left to watch My Cousin Vinny with mom -- such a great movie. (Thanks, Steve!) 12:50 I came back, and went back to it. And about fifteen minutes ago -- around 2:40 -- I solved my dilemma. As it turns out, I wasn't scanning deep enough into the registry. I found a bunch of wmmse.com strings in there, so I deleted all of them. Stupid things.  Of course, in the process, I accidentally killed the string that told IE to put http:// in front of a URL by default. So while I solved one problem, I had another to deal with. Another reinstall of IE fixed it easy, though.  So, Merry Christmas, everyone! Christmas was wonderful for me. Remember that webspace ordeal I had in my last post? Well, for Christmas, my brother gave me a great gift -- he ordered a premium webhosting package for me. I now have 50mb of space, 10gb bandwidth, and a ton of extra features, including PHP and all that jazz. The best part about it? Mwahaha -- the fact that my new URL is  urlLink www.thedelispick.com . Yes, I have a dot com. I'm rearranging the site again -- my last redesign is way too heavy on the tables, and I want a different look. That one doesn't satisfy me. It's sort of the same, just... just... different. You'll see. Eventually.  Anyhow, I'm back to watching the Cosby Show marathon and working on my site.

       " 'Aaaaaaaargh     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Half-asleep     It\\'s seven am... I just woke up from two nightmares. Urgh. I decided to go to bed on time last night, and ended up waking up around four or so. I was pretty thirsty, so I had some orange soda. I woke mom up, talked to her for a minute, then came back in and laid down at 4:20. I turned on the TV -- Three\\'s Company was on until five. Good. Closed my eyes.  I couldn\\'t fall back asleep. I laid there with my eyes closed for quite a while, but my stomach had decided to just sort of rumble for a little while. I just could NOT sleep. Eventually around 5:30 I drifted away.  I don\\'t know when I woke up next -- somewhere in the 6 o\\'clock area. I had dreamt that the house and building behind me had caught on fire, and mom was out of the house. I panicked. I could FEEL the panic, even in my dream. I tried to call 911, but every time I picked the phone up, the dial tone would fade immediately. The phone lines were getting screwed up by the fire. I couldn\\'t get online, or call the police, or anything. All I could think to do was to try and relax and play something on my PS2. I went outside, and my family was on the back porch, with firemen dressed in casual clothes working on the fire. Everything was just fine, but I was really nervous and all now, probably because in my dream my house was all rearranged and so it wasn\\'t familiar to me. That\\'s when I woke up.  Fell right back to sleep. That dream wasn\\'t bad. This one was worse.  I was at Cody\\'s house, and a lot of other people were there, mostly friends of ours. I sat down at a table with Cody and two others, and used the computer stationed there to check my mail. I opened Yahoo! Mail, and it was all weird -- this odd orange scheme. Instead of it saying that I had mail, however, it said this: \"Changes made successfully: 1.\" I thought something was up, so I clicked on the one. It said \"password changed.\" ...I hadn\\'t changed my password. I went to make sure it was the same, and I got a long, huge page. There were tons of subsequent pictures with words on them from the female hacker who had changed my password. It started with an obviously fake error message saying that somebody had gotten my pasword, and then had some more jumble. Some said things like \"Don\\'t say some stupid prayer, like \\'God please help me\\' or any of that crap\" and whatnot. I was panting hard as I read it all, and was freaking out. I kept saying aloud, \"My password, they got my password!\" but nobody really seemed to care. Cody just shrugged at it, and everyone else was uninterested. Again, I was in a panic. I couldn\\'t make sense of anything. After all, somebody had gotten into my mail account and changed everything around. Actually, it was all as if getting and changing my password was like giving me a virus, with the way the pictures were displayed. It surely doesn\\'t seem like much of a nightmare to you, the reader, but man, it scared the pants off of me.  I woke up breathing heavily and sweating. I was so glad it was a dream. When my head cleared, I remembered what Yahoo! Mail actually looked like and was a bit relieved. After that, I just had to get into Blogger and write all of this down in my blog. It was my best way of having the dream written down and being able to tell anyone who cares, later on in the day. At any rate, it\\'s 7:26 now and I want to play Castlevania a little before school. Have a good day, everyone.',\n",

Your stomach feels as if you\\'re very worried or really guilty about something -- hunger pains but no appetite. From then on, you enjoy a couple glorious days of discharge, with either diahhrea or vomiting. I had the symptoms. Came home at 11 yesterday afternoon, ate a sandwich, and felt just fine. So I slept. I woke up a couple hours later, called Jessie, messed around a bit afterward, etc. My teacher called sometime last night; they cancelled school today. (When your school contains 16 students, it\\'s easy to get an epidemic going strong.) So I had a nice day off. Furthermore, apparently many are STILL sick, so school was cancelled AGAIN tomorrow. Thus, I get a weekend within a week. I\\'ll have one day of school, then two days of weekend. Mmm-mm.  I\\'ve been playing Douglas Adam\\'s Infocom adventure game, Bureaucracy, as of late. The game is very funny, yet pretty hard, but it\\'s one of the only interactive fiction titles I can get into. (Surprising as Cody and I used to make these things all the time in eighth grade.) It\\'s a fun game, nonetheless, full of confusion and annoyances and featuring a llama and a one-winged macaw.  (For those who noticed the Spider-Man 2 template, it\\'s gone now. Why?

Tonight, Jessie spent hours working on a slideshow featuring pictures of the two of us with romantic captions set against \"The Luckiest\" by Ben Folds, which we sort of consider to be our song. She spent a lot of time fixing it up and creating it and putting it together, but after it was done, she had problems sending the .exe. It wouldn\\'t open for Mewd (whom she tested it on) or myself but it was opening just fine for her. We spent another couple hours trying to resolve the problem. She searched Photostudio 2000 for some kind of help or option or preference and I went as far as to download a couple trial versions of the program, all in an attempt to be able to open the file.  As it turns out, she had to send EVERYTHING -- the MP3 and pictures and all -- with the .exe. After she did this, I started it up, and learned for the first time what it\\'s like to cry from happiness. It was amazing. The words were very touching, and the pictures seemed to fit the words.

Nothing really exciting has happened before today.  Earlier, I found something incredibly interesting. At the  urlLink Janitorial Times , a fellow by the screenname of TheRisingSun had posted a fix for the SCI timer bugs in the old Sierra games, available  urlLink here . For those of you who know what I\\'m talking about, go check it out -- instead of slowing down your system with Turbo or Moslo, this is actually a patch for the games. You unzip the patch that applies to each game into its directory, then play it, and the timer problems are instantly solved! No more waiting forever for the elevator in Leisure Suit Larry 3! Space Quest 4, one of the buggiest games in Sierra\\'s history thanks to the screwy time, works like a charm!  The desert in Space Quest 1 VGA is actually playable!!  As I write this post, he\\'s only got a fix for SQ1VGA, SQ4, SQ5, SQ6, LSL3, LSL5, and PQ3, but as soon as he can get a copy of QFG4 he\\'s going to patch that game as well. I\\'m sure he\\'s also got other things planned. Either way, these patches really honestly fix the games. The timer problems become nonexistant, from serious problems (SQ4\\'s Droid o\\'Death, Skate-o-Rama, Sequel Police, etc.) right down to animation problems (SQ1VGA\\'s constant head-swivelling, super-fast cartridge retrieval droid bouncing, etc.). It\\'s like a miracle cure, only it really IS a miracle cure! Sierra fans with timer issues, check the patches out!  Secondly, Mewd and I buckled down and got to work on Sandwich Quest today. I decided that to get more work into my projects, I\\'m going to base my focus on one project and stick to that instead of bouncing back and forth between games. I decided that the one solo project I have that I want most to do is The Quest for the Meaning of Life. As such, MOL is my main goal right now. Well, kind of. I want to focus my solo effort on MOL, but I want an equal emphasis on Sandwich Quest. Basically, instead of having several projects, I have two that are what I want done most, and those\\'re what I\\'m going to stick to.  Anyway, yeah, Mewd and I did a lot of work on Sandwich Quest today. I had accidentally deleted the original file back a few months ago when we were working on it, and so I started rebuilding it today. We didn\\'t have much anyway, and all the stuff that was in the file was still on my hard drive, so I managed to keep all the art and stuff. I have the entire first room rebuilt; aside from that, I have the kitchen scene done and ready to be made into a room, and Mewd already has a lot of the descriptions written. Basically, I\\'ve pushed myself all night, and it\\'s paid off. I\\'m proud of what all we have, even if it isn\\'t a lot just yet.  However, it\\'s 5:53 in the morning, and I\\'m going to bed!

But it was all very realistic. I think I was kind of like Dante, from Devil May Cry. I was near the end of the game, as it was really short. I told mom that I was just going to leave and go back to doing something else, but as I was walking down this long hallway to leave, I had a feeling that my arch-nemesis would show up -- and he did.  He fell from the ceiling in front of me. I don\\'t remember much about his appearance except that he had these glowing white eyes, and strong, last-boss-like red and black armor.  We then fought. It was a REALLY taxing battle. He had very strong attacks, but I could block all of them with ease. But I could never hit him.  He would spawn these... zombie things. Only they were zombies also wearing red and black armor. They were tall and very thin, and I really couldn\\'t do much damage. I kept on pushing them out of the way, hitting them against walls, elbowing them and the like. I guess eventually I\\'d kill them, but I was juggling between then and the boss.  I kept trying to figure out how to kill the guy, but I couldn\\'t. I think I had a sword and a gun. Well, I know I had a gun. I could never harm him. He\\'d do this huge dash, then leap a couple times into the air and wail on me with a huge combo, but I would block it. When he would run back to the center of the hall, I\\'d attempt to run and hit him with a clothesline with my sword.  I thought this was effective, but I don\\'t think it was doing much. Finally, after a long battle, I managed to get him down onto the ground. I straddled him, curled my fingers in his hair, and pounded his skull mercilessly against the floor while calling for backup.  A few of my friends came and used some kind of ritual to draw the evil spirit out of him, and he returned to normal. Then I remember drawing my gun and saying, \"No, I\\'m not going to let you live,\" and trying to shoot him, but the gun wasn\\'t firing because the game was over.  And then, I woke up.  I also had a short dream about Jessie before that, but it was so  wild and passionate  that I don\\'t DARE talk about it here. (If seeing her sitting on the couch and reading is wild and passionate, that is.)  Anyway, it\\'s now 4:57, and you can bet your pants that they\\'re going to be calling soon for us to go to dinner. So until they do, I\\'m going to continue listening to Falconer. I\\'ve spent the past ten or fifteen minutes getting my blog to publish onto my website, instead of on blogspot.com. However, Blogger can be an unfunctional piece of crap, and so it isn\\'t working. I\\'ll just stay on Blogspot. It\\'s not that bad. And it\\'s a heck of a lot easier than fighting this thing.',\n",

There is so much I have left to say, and so many things I wish I would have said differently -- it\\'s a struggle to pick and choose what you want to say in the flash of an instant -- but I hope what I said had some effect on you. If ever you need to speak to me about God, if you ever feel compelled to go one step over what you\\'ve learned in all your therapies and whatnot, to lean over the calice you\\'ve built up toward God, IM me. Please, IM me. I\\'m more than willing to help you and encourage you. I guess all I can say is one thing Mewd mentioned: there\\'s a big difference between religion and God, and though your religion wronged you, God is completely different -- and from what you told me, entirely contrary to what you were taught. God loves you; I love you. Come to either of us and we\\'ll help you. I really don\\'t want to sound pretentious, but I would just like to stress how important it is to me -- somebody that barely knows you -- that you wind up with peace in your heart.  I won\\'t go into details -- here I am, writing in a public blog about somebody else\\'s personal life. I\\'m not saying any of this to embarrass her; rather, to rally a call for action. My Christian friends, please, PLEASE keep Kat in your prayers. You may or may not know her -- probably not. Still, God\\'ll hear you. Please pray for her. Pray that she recovers from her ailments, though most aren\\'t things that can just fade away. Pray that she learns the truth about the Lord, and His plan of salvation for us. Most of all, pray that she accepts Him in time, that she finds that He really is the closest confidant one can have. Again, not trying to embarrass her or pry into her business -- far from it. I\\'d just love to prove to her that God and His followers DO care about her, and the \\'cruelty\\' she saw in Him was an object of the devil.  That\\'s really all I can say about anything right now.

Day after day, I\\'ve struggled with that beast. Every other day -- quite literally -- it would develop bad sectors. Its performance fluctuated. The sound card was somehow becoming physically dislodged from the machine, as in the past couple of days it\\'s been suddenly cutting out sound-wise. I\\'ve had to tap or hit the chassis of the laptop where the sound card was in order to get the sound back. The monitor was already going bad, and would sometimes display funky lines on the screen. I would have to hit it a few times to knock it back into place. The thing was really banged up.  Tonight, I was hitting it to try and get my sound back, and it just blinked off. So I turned it back on. It would get past my Windows screen, then eventually just lock up. I rebooted, and Scandisk prompted; so I ran a scan. It tried to scan the directory structure but hung at 31%, claiming that a bad sector stopped it from being able to go further. It would try its little heart out to scan it but nothing was doing. I turned the computer off then back on. I was prompted with the menu that lets you boot in normal mode, Safe Mode, etc. I chose Command Prompt as I usually do to scandisk again. Typed scandisk at the DOS prompt.   Bad command or file name.   ...Okay, change directory to c:\\\\windows. scandisk.   Bad command or file name.   Um. Dir scan*.*? There was no Scandisk.exe. Anywhere.  Scandisk.exe had been wiped out.   Alright, so, maybe I can catch a fluke and load Windows. Restarted the computer. Not even my Windows 98 screen came up.

It did an automatic scandisk to check for drive integrity. Aaaand it hung again, just like last time, at 31%. I shut down and rebooted, and then copied scandisk.exe from the CD back to my hard drive. At least that was resolved.  However, since my laptop used interchangeable CD-ROM and Floppy drives, I had to shut down in order to switch drives. This posed a huge problem -- I could only get to my command prompt using the Windows 98 disc, and I needed my floppy drive to back up things. I looked around and eventually found my old Universal Boot Disk -- if I could use that to boot my computer, I could use another disk to back stuff up.  The idea worked. I managed to get into C: and grab some documents and images. I\\'m going to go back sometime in the near future when things have settled down and see if I can somehow get back into Windows. There\\'s a lot more I want to back up. Ohhh, is there a lot more. However, I\\'m not nearly in the mood to fiddle with it all now. I\\'m finally starting to ease up a bit. I\\'ve been very upset ever since it happened. I really wish I could just avoid school tomorrow and stay in bed, or maybe do something to cheer myself up. Whatever. The whole thing\\'s a mess. I\\'ve written too much already so I won\\'t go into my options for room-based personal computer replacement, or \"What I\\'m Going to Do to Get Back Online From My Room.\" I still have the PC out here, but mom uses it too. I need privacy.  Top it all off with the fact that I\\'ve had the menacing smell of grape soda stuck in my nose ever since Tim drank a can of it during our Chess match earlier, right now I\\'m not feeling my best. I have homework but I want to play Callahan\\'s Crosstime Saloon. Maybe I\\'ll just shrug my homework off for a while. I need something to cheer me up.',\n",

       " 'Troubled Waters     Current Song: \"Like the Rain,\" Clint Black   Current Mood: A bit upset     Many things to touch on in this update of El Bloggo.  First and foremost,  The Passion of the Christ  is one of the most powerful, influential, and humbling movies ever produced. The film speaks so much strength and really is a very refreshing event. People direly need to see just what Christ went through when He was crucified, and it took Mel Gibson to show them this side of His life.  Secondly, LucasArts has officially lost about 5,000 fans with their  urlLink cancellation of Sam and Max: Freelance Police.  A petition has risen to save the game from the knife of the LEC Glukkons. It\\'s already been cancelled, but we\\'re revolting in protest of the cancellation. Please, if you have any adventure game spirit in you or if you\\'re a big fan of Sam and Max or if you loved Hit the Road or if all of the above apply to you,  urlLink write them a letter expressing your disgust  or  urlLink sign the petition to bring it back.  This is an outrage. They\\'ll know their mistake.  Thirdmost, Warcraft III is the most fun I\\'ve had in a real-time strategy game since, well, since forever. As much as I liked starcraft, WC3 changes everything around and turns the RTS genre upside down. I LOVE the single player campaigns; I\\'m actually rather good at them. I REALLY suck at multiplayer, though, so I stray from battle.net play. But for an introvert, single player is enough for me. And when I finish the four campaigns of Reign of Chaos, I have the expansion, The Frozen Throne, to look forward to. What a wonderful world.  Anything else? No, don\\'t think so. Go see The Passion of the Christ. You must see this film. You need to see this film.',\n",
       " 'Lovesick     Current Song: \"A Kiss to Build a Dream On,\" Louis Armstrong   Current Mood: Melancholy     The current song is a really, really good one. Mewd sent it to me; it\\'s the theme from the PC game, Fallout 2. I was looking for some 50\\'s-style music for something I\\'m working on, and while it isn\\'t bouncy like I wanted, it\\'s a very good, very slow song.  I\\'m really feeling out of whack and disoriented right now. My grandmother, great-aunt, aunt, and uncle are going to Florida for ten days with travel time, and again, they\\'re calling on me to mind their house while they\\'re gone. I\\'ll be watching over my aunt, uncle, and grandmother\\'s house while two of my cousins are taking up my great aunt\\'s house next door. With my cousin David living at my aunt\\'s house, it\\'ll essentially be four cousins watching two houses.  This usually isn\\'t a problem, but apparently, David\\'s recently started to use the computer after everyone goes to bed. Hopefully there\\'s no contention for computer use. Also, since my aunt wants to use AOL in Florida, and doesn\\'t want the account tied up, I\\'ll be installing SBC Yahoo! Dial-Up over at her house, and using that to get online. I may just take my computer over and hook up all the peripherals to it, so I can have a familiar experience over there. With this there, my cousin probably won\\'t be too inclined to use it as it\\'s mine. However, I\\'m not sure. I\\'ll probably just use hers, and if I direly need my own PC, I\\'ll take it along. I\\'m not sure.  At any rate, the whole thing has me discombobulated. I\\'ve been sick for the past couple of days. Nothing serious -- diahhrea -- but all of last night, I had the distinct queasy feeling that I\\'d be vomiting. I spent two and a half hours going in and out of the bathroom for long periods of time. While I finally lied down at 2:40 or so, I didn\\'t actually fall asleep until 4 -- I just half-dreamed (you know, that thing where you\\'re conscious, but vivid thoughts are swimming in your head). I woke up again at 7 when mom went to work, and then actually got up at 11. I felt much better, at least. Still, that\\'s the second day this week I\\'ve taken a sick day, the first being Tuesday (I had the bug mildly but thought I had it bad). I\\'m not ready to go back, and I still don\\'t feel all together. I feel like things are happening really fast. And at the same time, I\\'m really emotional -- maybe it\\'s due to lack of sleep, or a combination of that with the traces of the bug still in me, but since Jessie left about half an hour ago, I\\'ve really, really missed her. Maybe it\\'s because the song is really romantic and melancholy or something -- I dunno. All I know is, I really wish I could talk to her again soon. I\\'ll probably call her before bed, as I always do, but... I dunno. I miss her.  Soon, we\\'re going over to my aunt\\'s house again. It\\'s 9:45 at the moment I write this. They\\'re leaving at 5:00am. Thusly, we won\\'t be there to see them off, unless mom and I wake up early. Anyway, we\\'re gonna go over there to say goodbye and for last-minute instruction and all that. I guess I\\'m just really nervous. I feel very alone, and I don\\'t know why.  Have a great weekend.

       " 'Current Song: \"Whiskey Lullaby,\" Brad Paisley   Current Mood: Melancholy?    I\\'m sorry that I\\'ve forgotten lately to update the ol\\' weblog. When I was at my aunt\\'s house, the dialup, combined with the forced 800x600 resolution and ultra-dim monitor, didn\\'t exactly leave me wanting to update.  The housesitting went about as well as possible. Catch an update: the ten days went slightly roughly, with me spending a lot of time cleaning and my cousin spending a lot of time not cleaning. When I\\'d finally be done cleaning and doing homework, he\\'d be online. For the most part, everything was alright, I suppose. Well worth the $100 pay, even though I wasn\\'t really doing it for the money. A few days after finally leaving their place, I spent a weekend over at my brother\\'s. Talk about refreshing. I had minimal cleaning up to do and plenty of freedom and aloneness. They didn\\'t pay me, but that\\'s no problem at all -- I didn\\'t expect any money for letting the dog out, eating Chips Ahoy and playing Baldur\\'s Gate. It was more of a vacation than anything.  Now, back to the present. I\\'ve had both Whiskey Lullaby and A Kiss to Build a Dream On in my head all day, and I was listening to both as soon as I got home, but eventually dropped off Kiss and am now just listening to Whiskey Lullaby. It\\'s a really sad song, about two people who drank themselves to death over each other.   \"She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger, And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. They found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life... We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby.\"   Mewd once said that he thinks it\\'s silly when people post lyrics, because you don\\'t get the full effect unless you hear the song. This applies. The song, as Jessie described it, is painfully eerie. Definitely the saddest song I\\'ve heard in a while. And you know what? I love it. I really dig slow, sad songs like this.  At any rate, today wasn\\'t too bad. The past few weeks, however, have been hellish. My schoolwork is really falling behind, and getting very late. I finally finished another part of Chemistry today -- I surprisingly aced the self-test with a 100 -- but Geometry and English are still nipping at my heels. Once I finish Geometry and English, though, I\\'m  finally  in the clear. It\\'ll feel good... really good. It\\'s like when you\\'re guilty of something, and the pain is eating away at you, clenching your heart and wringing it out, until finally you confess to someone, anyone, and the pain dissipates. Ashley\\'s felt the same heat I have. We both feel like we\\'re pretty much under the gun -- our infinitely untactful teacher loves to make us feel terrible with remarks that we would readily accept as advice with any other tone of voice. I dunno -- once I get this stuff done and in, I\\'ll feel so much better. Much better.  On the brighter side, I\\'ve added two additions to the Compaq -- another 256 megs of RAM and a 64 meg GeForce MX 4000 video card. It\\'s all souped up now, and plays Halo like a dream. Now I just need to get a job so I can buy Armed and Dangerous (the only exception I\\'m making to my \\'boycott LucasArts\\' mindset -- it\\'s my duty as a Sam and Max 2 revolutionary to support such a wonderfully made original effort at a game). I\\'m going to take my brother\\'s advice and look into a job at the local cemetary. Nobody would bother me there, and personally, I\\'d rather be haunted than deal with other human beings.  I think that\\'s enough for this entry, though. I\\'m going to do my homework then read or something for a while, waiting for Jessie. Heads up, Deli fans -- I have a new design in the works and I\\'m currently learning the humongously-awesome Inform programming code for making text adventures, or interactive fiction, if you will.

       " 'Current Song: \"I Believe,\" Diamond Rio   Current Mood: Productive (!)    Heyo, folks. Ready to blog? I sure am.  Confused by the title? I\\'m sure you are. Let me run it down for you, nice and easy: I\\'m wiping away my computer and starting fresh. I\\'ve reformatted computers several times; I\\'m a reformatting  demon.  Let\\'s see, I formatted my computer twice, then eventually got a new hard drive, and I formatted my laptop once. So that\\'s about four fresh starts. Anyhow, this is all ancient history; what you\\'re concerned with is the here and now (or, actually, in your case, the there and then, as you\\'re probably not reading this as I type it, unless you\\'re a hacker watching my every keystroke, and if you are, please bring me a doughnut, I want doughnuts).  Here\\'s the deal. My computer now has taken a liking to the dark side of freezing. It\\'s flirted with such evilness several times, even managing a convoluted fit of blue screens, once, where I could only use it one in four times after booting. It just wouldn\\'t work -- it\\'d load to the desktop, then, all of a sudden, without warning, without so much as a peep or a click -- WHAMMO! Blue screen! Recently, though, it\\'s decided to itself, \"Say, I think I\\'ll just freeze upon the occurance of some random little process deep in the bowels of my monstrous bulk.\" (And it\\'s bulky, all right. I once found a small child trapped inside.) \"Let\\'s see, how can I really ham this up? How can I truly peeve off the Typer Of The Keys? Think think think... aaahhhh... aha! Genius! I\\'ll  stop responding to everything he does,  yet at the same time I\\'ll let him  move his mouse all over the screen!  And while I\\'m at it, while I\\'m at it... ohhh, baby, while I\\'m at it, I\\'ll make a  slow, quiet ticking,  to make him THINK I\\'m doing something, but then ultimately letting him down when he realizes that I\\'ve committed neo-seppuku once more! Whoa! When can I start this... when when when... how about... how about next time he boots! Oh, Gatey,\" (my computer calls itself Gatey because it\\'s a retard) \"you are amazing. Give yourself a pat on the metallic hull, you nutsy beast.\"  This is the gist of my problem: random freezing. Among other things, of course. My massive 80-gig hard drive will likely take quite a while to format, so I\\'m going to go take care of that now. It is 4:29. I\\'ll write again in a bit -- sayonara!  -~-  Hey, blog reader! The time is now 7:53, and the formatting is well on its way. It\\'s formatting at about 1%/15 seconds, so that\\'s 4% in a minute. 40 in ten minutes, thus 80 in twenty, thus 100 in twenty-five -- it\\'ll be done around 8:15. There\\'s your Math Example of the Day?, kids.  I have five CDs worth of stuff; three containing data that I\\'m wanting to keep, and two containing old laptop backups that I don\\'t want to risk losing. I thoroughly, thoroughly scanned through my computer, combing C:, C:\\\\Program Files, and my Programs menu. I found things buried in deep, but the only things I couldn\\'t recover were my Neverhood saved games -- I don\\'t know WHERE The Neverhood programmed them to save to, but they sure as heck don\\'t go in the DreamWorks Interactive/Neverhood folder. Crazy people.  I\\'m pretty happy that I\\'m finally doing this. You know, even in its last hours, that computer gave me problems. It developed a nasty habit in which it would freeze for about thirty seconds every time I deleted files. I did a lot of deleting, too. In fact, I even did something childishly destructive, but it felt really good...  You know how, when you go into the Windows folder, it tells you not to EVER MESS WITH THE FILES INSIDE BECAUSE IF YOU TOUCH THEM,  YOU WILL BE TOTEMIZED ? Eheheheh... before quitting to DOS to format C:, I went into the Windows folder, and I  deleted random files!  Oh, it felt wonderful! I drug my cursor into a big box around some files, then hit Shift+Delete and wiped them out. Several times! My Windows folder looked like a post-war street with all the unpatched holes in it. Take THAT, Microsoft! And that! And that! ...And this, also!  So... so yeah. I\\'m gonna go on ahead and post this now -- thanks for sticking around to read my onslaught of C: formatting goodness.

I\\'m sitting here at Microsoft Works, pulling my hair out over an English assignment. It\\'s driving me up the wall. I have to write an editorial on some current event, debatable situation, or news item. After several starts, I just can\\'t seem to pull off the assignment.  I started by trying to write about how America hates President Bush, and the world hates America, and everybody thinks we\\'re policing the world. I wanted to take a stance against all this for once, and argue for America instead of against it. I gave up after a few failed paragraphs, though, and now have decided to write about how terribly corrupted America\\'s youth is today. I want to write a moving article about the vices that most teenagers so willingly accept. I\\'d just love to put together a rousing rally against trendy people with their trendy rap music and their annoyingly \"fashionable\" clothes  (what is so appealing about the color baby-blue, throwback jerseys, or $200 shoes!?) . Maddox said it best: we don\\'t need \\'metrosexual\\' pretty boys like Ben Affleck. We need real men, like Gregory Peck. I\\'m tired of seeing all these preppy pretty-boys. We need more lumberjacks and pirates. Men who wear flannel instead of cargo pants. This is what I need to stress in my argument.  But how do I start it?  I\\'ve given it more openings than the World\\'s Largest Sponge, but none of them seem to fit. I know WHAT I want to fight; I just don\\'t know HOW. So here I sit, blogging on this  urlLink annoying new Blogger interface  (yes, it\\'s terrible), while listening to Aerosmith and trying to squeeze an idea out of my pea-sized brain.  Speaking of Aerosmith, I just picked up their newest CD today: Honkin\\' On Bobo. I read about it returning to the band\\'s roots. The songs are all bluesy-rock, and they\\'re very well done. Aerosmith\\'s last CD, Just Push Play, was decent. I liked it, but the novelty wore off fast. This new disc is an entirely different story.

I finished System Shock 2, and it was great -- though the last boss wasn\\'t as drawn out as it should have been. Aside from that, I had a lovely excursion dying miserably in Warcraft III. Lessee, I also watched a bit of the Matrix: Reloaded. Man, that Smith fight scene was spiffy. \"Me, me, me.\" \"Me, too!\"  Is it just me or do kids suck? A group of three five-year-olds decided to tease the dog today. They accomplished this by pounding on the bedroom window and playing \"ring the doorbell then run like little five-year-olds about to receive a bloodthirsty hammer claw in the back of the neck.\" That game was a blast. Here\\'s how you play by example.  I hear the doorbell ring. \"Who could that be?\" I think to myself. I look up, and lookie there -- nobody at the door. So I get up and walk to the door, look out the window, and there\\'s nobody there. \"What gives?\" I ask. Looking at the sidewalk I see three little black kids, two girls and a boy (I think) running from my steps.  \"So this is what we\\'re gonna do tonight,\" I say to myself, and unlock the door. Next time I\\'ll be ready. I sit back down and go back to blasting the Many into oblivion in System Shock 2. Ten minutes later, the dog starts barking.  I get into position.  Looking outside, I find two of the little runts walking up to the front of the house. They stand right in front of the steps and look straight up at the door. The dog is barking, so they know they\\'re seen. Suddenly, one hoots a warcry!  \"Boo!\"  HWAH! I grab the handle and fling the door wide open. One bugger dashes. The other stands. Staring. Grinning.  I glare. I close the door. I lock the door. I say, \"Good riddance.\"  So after that, they left the place alone for a while. I was still pretty worked up over it, but I probably shouldn\\'t have been -- they were only five year olds. But they were unsupervised! Three five-year-olds, roaming the street, without a single parent watching them. Where were the parents? Why, next door, listening to some awful rap song at volume level 201.  But that\\'s entirely off the topic. Let\\'s go back to the battle. Later on in the night, we get struck again. I hear little feet on the front porch. I get up, and make a quick Solid Snake strut to the living room. I see one advancing up the porch, turning around to look at its cronies as they cheer on its valiant efforts in budding vandalism.  It reaches for the doorbell. PHWAMP! The door flies open.  It stares at me.  The following dialogue is not even worthy of a Battle.net player.  \"Can I help you?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"What do you need?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Why are you on my porch?\"  \"...\"  \"What do you want?\"  \"I want co\\' inside.\"  \"I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t help you.\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Please stay off my porch. Don\\'t ring this doorbell.\"  \"Yeah.\"  The little product of unsafe sex starts to run off the porch. No sooner was my door halfway closed -- halfway closed -- when they decide that the dog in the window wanted to be teased.  She\\'s barking, the kids are giggling, and I scream,  \"DO NOT AGGRAVATE MY DOG.\"  I\\'m fuming. I look out the front door window to see three little cornholes rushing away from the window.  The battle was over, but I was pumped. I tossed on some loud music really fast then proceeded to get offline and brood for a little while. I wanted to read but ended up just listening to Sonne and punching a pillow. I got my frustrations out, then decided to watch some of the Matrix before getting back online a short while ago.  What a fun night!  Before I hit the \"Publish Post\" button down there on my little Blogger GUI, I leave you with this thought:  urlLink it doesn\\'t get any worse than this.

No, I didn\\'t just wake up -- I\\'m just now going to  sleep.  You know, this post used to say \"7:11am,\" until I  deleted the whole flipping thing on accident!  Arrgh! Twenty minutes, dust! Hrrm.  We got a lot of work done tonight on Sandwich Quest. I finished up the interior of Turnip\\'s car, and Mewd churned out a few more descriptions. This game is really starting to take a great shape. The art is progressing nicely, the writing is, of course, hilarious, and the music is looking quite promising. In fact, Rav informed me tonight that he\\'s already quite a ways through two songs -- Salami Mafia and the tentatively-titled Title Theme. The more we do, the more experienced and hyped up we get -- I\\'m honestly hoping for a fall release. At least, end of summer.  I had a lot written here, and to be honest, I really don\\'t have the heart to rewrite it. I mean, I had a good four paragraphs -- four long paragraphs. Then I hit control-z to fix a mistake, and it deleted half of my post! Very frustrating. I\\'ll rewrite it tomorrow night, when my feelings of enthusiasm are fresh again. Sorry about this. I\\'m gonna go get some sleep -- not that I\\'ll be able to; my head is throbbing from my desperate attempts to tear out my hair.  Go read my profile if you\\'re interested in learning more about me.

ElRavager5: ::potential tunes begin coursing through brain:: I it\\'s kewl with you, I\\'d like to try some concept BG-music... RenoSix: Wait. You mean you\\'re willing to compose for us? Or am I just hallucinating? ElRavager5: I\\'d be delighted to. It\\'s already very funny, and I\\'d love to try and come up with a corresponding soundtrack. RenoSix: Whooooa. This is quite a shock, as Mewd and I were just discussing how we wish we could have original music. ElRavager5: Yeah, I\\'d love compose for it. Most of my recent stuff has been incredibly intense, moody, and atmospherically dark. It would be a great change to do something in the humorous category.  This  rocks.  We were needing a composer. We don\\'t like strangers. El Ravager is no stranger. This rocks.  I can\\'t get over it. We have a team. Team. Team, team. Teaaaaam. Team. TEAM! team. Teeeeeeeaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmm... teamteam. Team. Team. 4:41am. Team.  I love the sound of that. Not just \"Mewd and Reno,\" we\\'re now \"The Sandwich Quest Team.\" It has such a ring. The Sandwich Quest Team. The Team. Team. Teaaaaaaaaam.  That\\'s all I have to say, though. I\\'m so happy. We have a composer now! And things are going so swell. Why, so swell, I think I\\'ll post another random chat excerpt. Enjoy!

       " 'Current Song: \"Sweating Bullets,\" Megadeth    I changed my layout again. Tee hee. (Remind me to never say \"Tee hee\" again. Ever.)  Tee hee.  (Ah, crap.)  Let the blogging commence. Lost the old layout. It was starting to rust, and I had to let it soak in the bathtub. I have this odd feeling that my weblog is not at all exciting. There are interesting ones, like  urlLink ToastyFrog  and  urlLink that one that Al Lowe linked to in today\\'s CyberJoke 3000  (Top Ten Worst Album Covers Ever. Devastatin\\' Dave...  yikes ). Then, there are boring ones, like  urlLink mine . What gives? Why isn\\'t my weblog cool?  I asked a team of real scientific analysts why my blog isn\\'t cool. After much heavy debate and research, not to mention a flat rate of $24.95, they presented me with a fifteen-page report, containing 8,000 words and four charts. Never one for reading, I leafed through it carelessly and came upon one single line that I think sums it all up perfectly.   Your blog, unlike Explosive Mandolin, has no zany, random chat excerpts.   Well, if it\\'s excerpts the people want, it\\'s excerpts they get!  RenoSix: I need to have a random conversation for my blog, any ideas? Ducktor Schmitty: tuna RenoSix: TUNA  My blog just got 21.2% cooler.        And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I just  HAD  to write about this. Thrilling adventure always makes for great content.  Earlier, while laying the smackdown on Don Flemenco for the second time in Punch-Out!!, I saw a little figure wobbling by my mouse. A little figure that turned out to be a small roach. Now, we don\\'t get many roaches here. In fact, I\\'ve only killed one or two. It wasn\\'t a hollywood cockroach, but a little one that resembled a beetle. They come around every now and then to harass me. I\\'m sure your house has them somewhere, too. Creepy, huh? Anyway.  I told Mewd about it. He stuck beside me on my quest to find the little turd and maim it. I couldn\\'t find it -- exposure to the light caused it to fritter away at a lightning-fast speed, and when I chased it down with my intense, heavy-duty flashlight beam, it took cover off the computer desk.  I vowed to kill it before the night was up.  Well, just now I was admiring my new blog layout and name, I caught out of the corner of my eye, a little figure crawling up the lamp stand. I muttered a few unkind words, spun around, grabbed the flyswatter, and did another 180 turn to the lamp. It was out of sight, on the other side of the pole. So I struck the lamp to catch the little creep\\'s attention. It frittered around, completely unaware that I\\'m right handed and I had a perfect swing range. I brought down the flyswatter on that waste of life and drew the flyswatter back victoriously. I think it fell down into my fan and got diced by the blades.

I\\'ve been with Jessie for a year. I still remember this day a year ago -- how anxious I was, and how we were kept waiting even longer when her mom and brother were over and taking forever to leave. But it\\'s  really  hard to believe that it\\'s already been a year. Still, it\\'s been a very, very happy year, chock full of romantic moments -- like when my ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night while I was playing Gabriel Knight 1. Oh, or how about when she fell asleep while online and I panicked for half an hour when she wouldn\\'t respond to anything I did? And I\\'ll never forget the time I called her at 5:30 in the morning, apologizing for hanging up on her, when we\\'d actually gotten off the phone an hour and a half earlier.

       " 'Current Song: \"Masquerade,\" Symphony X     First off, apologies to all who did not see me online tonight (last night? I dunno, it is presently 6:30am). I spent six and a half hours on the phone with Jessie tonight (huzzah for \\'free nights and weekends\\'), mostly playing GK3, partly chatting. We decided to ditch our \\'competition\\' and, instead, play the game moreso \\'together.\\' She restored to where I was and we started going through together. Granted, we\\'re now sharing our progress with each other and helping each other out, but this is something we\\'ve always wanted to do -- play an adventure game together -- and GK3 gives us a great chance. We\\'re restricting ourselves to only playing while on the phone; I still haven\\'t caught up to her 480pts, but I\\'m well on my way -- I think we\\'re around 430. Day 2, 5pm - 10pm. It\\'s really getting good, I must say, though awfully creepy. SPOILER:  Man, Prince James\\' agents being murdered was a huge surprise. Jess and I both have theories about what happened. Jeez, that word really gets around in this game -- theory.  There, no eyes harmed who haven\\'t played the game. Just highlight that huuuuge blank space for things not fit for print.  More cool blank space!  Aside from GK3 and QFG5 (whom I have been neglecting, I\\'m sorry, Silmaria), I can\\'t say things have been at their hottest lately. I\\'ve been reading The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy a  LOT  lately. I haven\\'t read it in years, and it\\'s really great stuff. I\\'m already halfway through the first book in the trilogy (note: yes, Jessie, a trilogy *can* have five books. You\\'re just anal, that\\'s all.) and it hasn\\'t slowed down yet. I\\'m rather enjoying the book -- and why shouldn\\'t I? It\\'s the Hitchhiker\\'s Guide!  I  have  been in the midst of a problem. A crisis of sorts if you want to get melodramatic. I spoke with Rav about it... two nights ago was it? I don\\'t remember, these summer days are a blur. Anyway, this has really suddenly sprung up, and I don\\'t like it. It\\'s an old fear of mine, really, and it\\'s been stuck on me for as long as I can remember. (I\\'m not stalling or setting up for some big comedic joke, just giving you some backstory. Like you care.) I\\'ve always been afraid of turning eighteen; not because that\\'s when I \\'start\\' on my life or because I go out on my own or because of college or anything like that. I must admit, to all of you who I\\'ve mentioned my fears of getting older -- I\\'ve been feeding you a white lie this whole time. No, the real reason I\\'m so anxious and restless about turning eighteen, despite it being nine months away, is because I\\'ve always had a fear, a phobia if you will, of being drafted into the Army. Silly, isn\\'t it? That\\'s what I\\'ve convinced myself, but I\\'m afraid that with our recent war thing and all, by April of \\'05 they\\'ll be needing to recruit more soldiers and thus, will delve into America\\'s lazy, Gen-X youth.  I know, it\\'s a very silly thing to worry over, as there hasn\\'t been a draft for a long, long time. It\\'s just that, well, I\\'ve always had a feeling that by the time I turn eighteen they\\'ll be in a war and in need of more support. Jessie insists that I have nothing to worry about, and Rav doubts I need to be concerned. The rest of you I\\'ve been silent about my problem to, either because you won\\'t care or because I don\\'t want to bugger you with my petty worries because I\\'ve thrown my burdens onto you one-too-many times (this only applies to one of you and  urlLink you know who you are ). I just... I really don\\'t know. I don\\'t know what to make of my worries. The one thing I\\'ve been dreading more than anything all of my life is conscription into the military. I mean it. If it wasn\\'t for that, I\\'d be perfectly secure in my future. To be honest, though? I think this is God\\'s way of convincing me that I need to attend college.  I\\'ve shrugged it off with many, many petty excuses -- I don\\'t need it. I can\\'t afford it. I can live without it. I don\\'t want to go to school for another four years. Every time I make one of these stupid, insignificant excuses, I cringe and realize that I\\'m stalling. God knows this. He knows my problems and struggles. He\\'s also guiding me through them. I have no excuse against college anymore, and I know it. I\\'m no longer going to reply \"College? Nah.\" It\\'s college all the way for me. I really do need it, despite my reluctance, and it\\'ll excuse me from being drafted. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll be able to afford it, but there are grants and student loans. God\\'ll protect me. I know it. Why should I have any reason to fear? Really, why? The hand of God is covering me and shielding me; His gift of everlasting love, peace and grace is plentiful and mine for the taking, so why should I hold back? It\\'s like the old hymn; \"What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and grieves to bear...\"  Anyway, I don\\'t want to get overly zealous here -- and I have some reading to do. All of you, I\\'ll talk to you tomorrow. Pray for my peace. The more I write and think about my discussion with Jessie over the topic, the more rest and ease I feel. How great God is.',\n",

I was going strong with rapid updates for a while, but I\\'ve sorta dropped off the map for a few days. Why? Read on and find out.  First, I should probably explain my last entry -- things are really hectic with Jessie. I won\\'t go into details out of respect for her and her family, but, well, let\\'s put it this way -- her grandma, after some really unfortunate consequences, is barely hanging on to life. She was bleeding internally, and, while she was given a month, she\\'s barely lasted a few days after they discovered it. Jessie\\'s been really strong, though, and I\\'m proud of her.  This has caused quite a bit of unrest and grief -- so much that progress on Sandwich Quest has halted temporarily. Well, I can\\'t pin it all on the morbid situation in Indiana -- Mewd\\'s been having some awful connection problems and I went onto a Quest for Glory kick the night I mentioned beating QFG3. I beat QFG4 the other night, though, for the first time ever, and am now on QFG5. Deathfoot the Wizard is on the third Rite of Rulership, and has plans to defeat the vile Hydra once and for all! Or not.  Also: I started up Gabriel Knight 3 the other night, and have since been juggling between Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned and Dragon Fire. Man, GK3 is one tough adventure game. For all you sports fans keeping tabs at home (read: 0), I\\'m on Day 1, 12pm - 2pm. I was stuck for a couple nights (mornings? What a schedule) in the first time block, but I  finally  managed to trigger the next one. I\\'m having a good time, though. GK3 isn\\'t nearly as bad as I expected gameplay-wise. The camera gimmick takes some getting used to, but it works very well. I\\'m content with it, and having a blast. It\\'s really amazing the amount of true history that Jane Jensen incorporated into the game; I never thought France could be so interesting. And it\\'s even moreso intriguing that Rennes le Chateau is a real place. And I\\'ll admit, Tim Curry isn\\'t too bad as Gabriel... but  Dean Erickson is still the real Gabriel Knight.  I insist on it. Mewd, Rav, you can say what you want.

Startlingly bad transition from humorous to serious topics!: Jessie\\'s grandmother passed away on July 3rd. This afternoon marked the funeral. Thanks to all my blog readers, gullible as you are for actually buying into this whole \"Ric\\'s life\" thing, that prayed for her and remembered her family. She appreciates it very much. I would say more, but as before, I\\'ll keep it at that out of respect.  So I\\'m going to dad\\'s house tomorrow morning. This is not good. I love my dad and enjoy visiting, but...  I have to get up at 8:30.  What am I, insane? 8:30? No, no, completely true. It sucketh. BUT! I can manage. By the time I get home on Sunday, Rav\\'s package, chock full of all the Weird Al CDs I could ever want, will have arrived, and I\\'ll be basking in the glory of CDs-I-currently-only-have-on-cassette. Man, cassette sucks. This is especially for you, cassette nerds: your medium sucks! Aahahaha! L0sers! LOL n00bs!  Also -- \"Weird Al\" Yankovic - The Ultimate Video Collection rocks. This is all I can say about such a breathtaking masterpiece of stereophonic sound spectacular.  Anyway, before I go and end this blog entry, a crime scene revealed its ugly head the other day and I need your help in discovering the hideout of the perp. I was here at the computer, minding my own business, when I looked over, and, well... it\\'s gruesome, but... here\\'s what I saw.       If anybody has any ideas as to the whereabouts of this vicious killer knife, Henry the Hellbleeder, please disclose all tips and tricks to me. Murderers of innocent aluminum must be stopped!   Isn\\'t that little supernova flashy effect on the blade cool? I did that myself.',\n",

       " 'Current Song: \"Mr. Popeil,\" Weird Al      And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I was lying in bed last night (this morning?) when I realized that I hadn\\'t written about this in my last post, so I have to do it now. So I was on the phone with The Rav last night when I glanced over and saw a roach climbing the privacy curtain on my door. He was of a good size, and ON MY FRICKIN\\' DOOR.  Now, naturally, when I see one of these buggers, I tend to shoot my glance around my immediate area to find something that suits the slaughter. I was about to grab my mouse\\'s wrist pad to crush him, but then I saw him: Henry the Hell-Bleeder.  Despite his controversy in the vicious murder of those Mountain Dew cans, Henry\\'s not a bad guy. Sure, he tends to be dangerous, and, actually, quite sharp, but he\\'s used his amazing superpowers for good before. In fact, a nice example of this is last night. Funny story: I actually had to pull the impaled can off of his blade because it had been on there ever since snapping the photo. Okay, it wasn\\'t that funny.  So I grab Henry, explaining to Rav the direness of my situation. Then, wielding Henry in my right hand, I slashed at the beast. Several times. Let me tell you, I put medieval knights to shame. Actually, I think it\\'s more like: I give medieval knights shame. I missed. Many times. In fact, I think the roach was more afraid of the thunderous crash of steel on door rather than the impending doom of a sharpened blade swinging above its doomed person. It scampered about worriedly, always in the opposite direction of the last place I lowered the knife. Finally, the shockwaves dislodged it from the curtain and the creep fell to the floor. Mr. Rav witnessed my cunning fumbling tendancies with a sharp object as I sliced time after time at the roach, eventually crippling it. Henry tasted blood as he made a nice, clean laceration through the center of the bug. It was quite a sight.  Of course, the insect was still wriggling, and now it was on the toe of one of my slippers. I didn\\'t want it to get away. It had already almost scampered to safety upon plummeting to the ground, and I wasn\\'t about to mark this down as a missed opportunity to actually kill something with my dagger. So rather than swipe and slash blindly and risk ruining my slipper, I angled the blade and smushed that sucker with the side. Let me tell you, I\\'ve never been happier to see roach entrails. Henry was victorious! Viva la revolucion!',\n",
       " 'Current Song: \"Gotta Boogie,\" Weird Al    Technical date: 7/13 Renoish date: 7/12  Hey, sports fans, welcome to the weblog. Today\\'s been a solidly awesome day. You know how I can prove this? When I woke up, there was a cold Coke in the fridge. You know how long it\\'s been since I\\'ve had a real Coke? Nearly two months. I had one at my rich uncle\\'s house, but oddly -- and I\\'m not exaggerating -- the Coke they have there always, ALWAYS tastes Diet. I think it has to do with the fact that he has more money than humanly necessary. You know how I can prove THIS? He has eleven bathrooms.  If I\\'m exaggerating, it\\'s only barely.  So after inhaling the Excellent Soda Coke (Double Fine fans, accept this generous injoke), I went on to enjoy a way-cool day. You heard me -- way-cool. I phoned up my buddy Rav and proceeded to make his ears bleed for five hours. That was a lot of fun. I\\'ve never, EVER taken part of that many Weird Al references via voice. Heck, I think our back and forth reference-battling has even toppled our online reference-battling. Ah, well, what can I say? I\\'m just Such a Groovy Guy. If you don\\'t agree with me, tough -- Everything You Know Is Wrong. I would stop my incessant referecing, but why should I stop now? Look, I\\'ll Be Mellow When I\\'m Dead. Maybe I\\'m just a Couch Potato, but you can stop me by watching The Brady Bunch. Come on, I Can\\'t Watch This! It saddens me that they even bothered putting it on Cable TV, let alone let the entire block watch it on Frank\\'s 2000\" TV. For what it\\'s worth, maybe I\\'m just Addicted to Spuds, but that\\'s what happens when you\\'re Young, Dumb and Ugly -- you tend to Dare to be Stupid and use Ebay even more than Eddie Vedder. Oh crap, Why Does This Always Happen to Me? I\\'m on a tangent. I\\'d better stop before I start talking about how It\\'s All About the Pentiums.  El Ravager now hates me.   And this is at 8:30 in the morning!   (By the way, speaking of, my visit with Dad went just dandily. I called, left a message on his voice mail, then held my breath as I waited for his return phone call. He ended up returning at noon, just as I requested -- I then went and fixed his computer, then spent a wonderfully listless night trying to sleep on the couch, waking up every hour to another rerun of Full House. But his computer is mostly fixed! It still freezes horribly, sadly, but I worked around this problem by installing  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  on his computer instead of Internet Explorer. Seems there\\'s a bug in IE or something that\\'s causing a huge conflict with his computer, because when I cut off its circulation, freezing was no longer an issue. Oh well, Firefox rules anyway. But other than that, everything\\'s awesome and spiffy on his PC. Sucky thing. Don\\'t buy anything from Hewlett Packard unless it\\'s a printer.)',\n",

       " 'Current Song: \"I Hate Everything,\" George Strait    Got office chair?  urlLink I sure do.   So Blogger has this new WYSIWYG bit. I don\\'t know how much I like it. I mean, it\\'s actually really great, because it allows for people without much experience to edit their weblog without needing to know HTML (read: wimps). But I demand hardcode-ability! I\\'m an HTML veteran, I don\\'t need these easy versions. I type out my code by hand! I\\'m a MAN! Woof! Grrr!  Right. Lessee, I should probably tell you that last week I went to my Uncle\\'s house for two nights and had a blast. Wings and steak by day, movies and popcorn by night. Watched the western  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  Thursday night and  Rocky IV  Friday night. Both really good movies. (Great, my dog just got up and tossed her cookies for no apparent reason. And we\\'re out of paper towels.) Other\\'n that, we had a lot of fun. Lots of good conversation, and I managed to fix all their computer problems for them. I r00lz.  Man, I wish we had some paper towels.  Hmm, let\\'s see, other than that... oh, we went to the library the other day. That was great. I picked up a whole lotta cool stuff. *\\'s next to things I needed for research for my newest novel (i.e. it was either a book on the 40\\'s or a film noir).   Books:    The Age of Doubt: American Thought and Culture in the 1940\\'s*      DVDs:    The Man Who Wasn\\'t There*   The Third Man*   Monty Python\\'s Life of Brian   Big Trouble   Office Space      VHS:    Touch of Evil*   The Big Sleep*   Detour*   Monty Python\\'s Flying Circus vol3     Exciting, huh?! Yeah, I know, you\\'re thrilled. The story\\'s doing well, of course, though I need to finish up the plot. It\\'ll probably be set around 1948... good old fashioned film noir detective story. No, not a Sherlock Holmes-esque bit, I\\'m talking  film noir.  Black film. Struggling private eyes, seductive femme fatales, crooked cops, shady characters, underhanded criminals,  blackmail  whitefemale*, betrayal, disguise, and deceit -- the works, baby. Best kind of movie out there if you ask me. A rainy night, a down-on-his-luck private dick, a damsel with a request, a twisted world where nothing is what you think it is... ohhh yeah, my kind of story. It\\'s a thrill to be writing one of these.  By the way, I\\'ve only watched The Man Who Wasn\\'t There and The Third Man since my trip to the library on Wednesday. The Third Man is a classic noir -- wonderful, wonderful story and dialogue and whatnot. I\\'d seen it before, and so I knew what to expect, but the DVD was remastered and all that and presented a brilliant reparation of the old film. I wouldn\\'t mind owning that movie, to be honest. The Man Who Wasn\\'t There was disappointing. I mean, it was a great movie, but some of Billy Bob Thornton\\'s acting was overdone (he was supposed to play a quiet barber, but he played a TOO quiet, wooden barber), and a few sequences were rushed. Awesome twist at the end, though. This movie was the perfect example of the essence of noir: a sneaky proposition, a risky chance, and from there, a downhill mudslide. I felt very bad for Ed Crane: he only wanted an escape from the mundane, but a few baaad decisions made his life turn upside down and then fed it to a kraken. Like I said, it\\'s really a great movie and I have nothing against it -- but I was expecting a lot more than what was presented to me. My expectations WERE rather high, though.  Anyhow, I\\'m off now. Mewd is typing something, and I don\\'t know what it is. Wait, no, he sent the IM. Nevermind. G\\'night, folks!

       " 'Today,....... hmmm. What to say about today, and whatever else has happened since my last post. I cant say anything here that would make up for whatever it is that ive done in the period of time prior to this entry. Im not going to call attention to anything that is particularly depressing tonight. Im done with that. Im not going to let myself feel guilty for something that i \\'did\\' that doesnt require an action. I apologize, but i wont let myself feel bad. Thats the way ive decided i want to live my life, and thats how i will. Anyways, Neal and I took Emily out for lunch today as a late birthday lunch. We partook in various Italian festivities while dining at Joe\\'s, and somehow started the day long conversation of \"What are cars named after?\" What in the hell is an Alero? Montero? Vue? Nobody knows. Anyways, after lunch, we all rode in Neal\\'s car to Baskin Robbins, because 1) Emily wanted to go there, and 2) She didnt want to drive in the \\'rain\\'. When we arrived, we deliberated upon which flavor of ice cream we wished to consume. Since im boring, and according to them, i like no food, ever, (but i am a fan of racism and Nazi\\'s appearantly...), that i decided to just stick with the cookie\\'s and cream. They on the other hand had to take the purity and wonder that is ice cream, and crush it beneath neal\\'s (terribly clothed) legs of justice. They decided to buy \" X-MINT.\" Some lame flavor to celebrate a far more amazing piece of cinematography. Ok, here\\'s putting it lightly. It was the most unappetizing looking substance in the history of mankind. It was black, yes black, tar black even, and a dark blue. It looked like bubblegum on black top. Disgusting. So of course, they eat it, completely content that im totally and entirely disgusted by it, and then we decide to go roaming. The first stop, \"  Cascades....\" (in a whisper). Then around the Krispy Kreme parking lot. We saw a lot of nice houses, we gawked, and continued wondering what car names meant. Is a Grand Cherokee a really really really awesome Native American? Anyways, Emily had to go to work, so Neal came over and hung out for a while. We did nothing. For an excrutiatingly long period of time. Then Neal wanted to set up my bench press rack thing, which then involved rearranging my entire game room in order to do so. With that finished, and the clock reaching 9:30, Neal decided he was hungry, so he left. I didnt eat. James came home from Las Vegas later, and brought me some stuff. I smiled, its awesome stuff. And now im here, talking to my cousin from California online. Its been a great day, a simply fantasmic day. Nothing can bother me as of this moment. Oh yea, and Jeff didnt come to my house at 12:45 to get some blank cds without his parents knowing on a bike, in case you were wondering if anything of the sort occurred, because it didnt.

Anything that has to do with teeth is pretty much unjustifiable by medicinal reasons, and is almost always unbearable. Ive been trying to help her out all day. It made me really realize how much she does around the house, its crazy. I love my mother, as do most of my friends. She\\'s adopted half of them, and she\\'s always so cool about having people hang out over here. She\\'s the coolest. Anyways, i was listening to music, (quietly), and just decided to download the most random stuff ever. Stuff that would irritate the hell out of most people. Can anyone say, \"Im a punk rocker..\"? Ugh... Yea, she dont know no David Bowie, no Sex Piestols, she\\'s like 17, they\\'re like 100. Anyways, i was listening to one of Avril\\'s songs, and i just kinda noticed how during parts of the song, she sounds just like Ashley Elgie. Im serious. Listen to \"Im with you\", (for as long as you can stand it), and think about how Ashley sounds, its like exactly the same. Anyways, we didnt end up getting any pictures of Toby and his yellow diaper of justice, i wish we wouldve, but the memories will last forever. Haha, still funny... Oh yea, Michael and Jeff came over the day before yesterday, we hung out, it was pretty cool. Michael and I got pissed that Jeff was so good at Clone Wars, i was about to strangle the kid. We were P-I-S-E-D...... Pised? Im taking Emily out for her birthday tomorrow for lunch, anywhere she wants. She\\'s not doing a good job deciding where she wants to go though. Hmmm, i played some more Metroid Prime today. Im still afraid of Meta-Ridley. Im pretty much afraid of that whole game, i dont really know why, cause its not scary. Ill probably try and finish it tomorrow. After lunch, if Emily ever makes up her mind. Jeff leaves friday, ill have another less person to talk to/hang out with, itll be sad. Meh, he\\'ll have a good time in the north. I talked to a girl that i like today, we\\'re gonna hang out some day next week. She\\'s gonna stop by after she gets done doing her extensive cross country mandatory workout. Hopefully itll be a good time and i wont just be retarded.   Im feeling unusually content right now. Pretty much everybody i know, or care about at the moment, is happy. Its awesome how summer does that to people. My views on unhappy people are that they shouldnt keep hanging out with people that: A) Make them unhappy, or B)Are also unhappy. Im in a great mood, i have plans to do stuff this week and weekend. Itll be a good time. Haha, south park is a funny show, i just remembered a quote from the episode, \"Asspen\". A ski instructor was telling the boys how to ski, and he used the pizza and french fries analogy. \"If you pizza when you shouldve french fried, you\\'re gonna have a bad time. If you forget to pizza, you\\'re gonna have a bad time.\" \"When are we supposed to be having a good time?\" Haha, download it, its priceless. U2 is one of the greatest bands of all the world.

I wonder if i have any sharp knives in my house... My head still hurts. I wish i could make somebody happy. Just at least one person, thats all i want. To make somebody truly happy for once. I want to be able to make somebody cry or pass out, or faint, or just fall over giddy in glee and joy. I could care less how i feel at that moment, but i just want somebody to be happy by my hands. Maybe Jacob is right, maybe i should open up more. But then again, what is this, pretty much open to me. Its not like i expect anybody to solve my problems. Thats the reason for why i dont even ask for help. I wonder why i feel the way i do sometimes. At least everybody else pretends they're happy most of the time.

I know ive asked everyone reading this at least once if im bothering them, or if im annoying them in some way, and im trying to make that stop, because one of my friends, a great one in fact brought to light how freakin annoying that is. Needless to say, that will stop, at all costs. I also am going to try to think more about myself, not selfishly or egotistically, but more along the lines of getting to know who i am, what im good at, what im not, and learning to accept, and actually get to the point of knowing and enjoying who i am. My other concern in my life right now is that ill never experience love. Its silly to think that now, being only 16 years, 1 month, and 24 days into my life, but regardless of that fact, i feel like im missing out on a lot. My parents tell me such great stories of how their high school sweet hearts brought them such joy, and how it helped them learn and grow as a person. I want to feel that, i want to know that, i want to be able to tell my kids about it. Many of you wont, and probably never will understand how i feel, but i appreciate those of you who have at least tried.   Anyways, off that topic, i had the opportunity to hang out with some of my favorite people today. Kacy Peek, Jordan Peek, Neal LeBlanc, Cassie Cervenka, Allison Bennet, Brittany Payne, and Emily Hahn. They are wonderful, simply amazing. This summer so far would have been total crap if it wasnt for them. Also, ive gotten to talk to a bunch of new people online, and otherwise, you know who you are, but meh. Friends are great, have some, if you dont, you\\'re a loser, and you should get some. Hmmm, what else to write, this is a first entry after all, so im not sure. Everybody else writes such beautiful things in their journals. Meh. This isnt for the enjoyment of others after all, i am pretty much talking to myself here. Kinda like how Emily says everything she types aloud when she\\'s on AIM. Haha, good times.  Might as well end it with something clich\\xe9.

It wont be awful. Ill see people. The freshman will be there......... Ill see people, that at least is good. Maybe that girl who flirted blatantly x4 towards me has calmed down. I hope so. Or maybe i dont. I dont know, i guess im desperate. I dont think ill have many plans for the next couple of months, which is kinda depressing, but school wont be so bad. We always make school seem like Hell during the summer. It is sometimes, but half the time you\\'re having fun. ................... \"And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show............. STARS!!!!!\" Oh geez. I cant wait........ This show has to be better than the show with the Japanese techno we played while forming \\'elemental\\' shapes on a football field. It must be better. It cant not be better. But geez, stars. Why couldnt it have been like, \"And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show, The Legend of Zelda!\" or, \"Star Wars\" if you really wanted to keep some of the \\'stars\\' effect. I would be all for that, just give me some awesome music, something ill recognize thats catchy and most likely not playable, and im set. You know what would be a great show, a Lord of the Rings show, like where some special color guard people could be the fellowship and such, and some could be orcs and elves and men and dwarves, (sadly to say, id be recruited as a freakin dwarf), but i would really like to be a Ring Wraith. There\\'s nothing cooler than that. Nobody would be allowed to be Legolas, cause then they\\'d be perfect, and then everybody would hate them. Anyways, im just trying to distract myself from \\'stars\\' for a little while by making up entire different shows. But whats sadder, is that im distracting myself from marching with other marching. Impressive, i know. Im ludicrously bored. I wish i could think of something inspiring or deep to say. But thats it, ^, right up there. Im not too clever as of today. People came over last night, it was fun. Thats it. Im about done. Actually i am. Finished. Fin.

       " 'Hmmm. Im not deserving of this life im given. Im wasting this gift by making bad choices and doing wrongs to my \\'friends\\'. The mere fact that i have friends still puzzles me. The fact that they read this, and ask me if im alright is something that i dont understand. Why do they care, why does it matter to them that i feel the way i do. I dont understand what makes them worry or what makes them fret over the bendable words that are written out in this journal. Why does it interest people to delve into my life, as they attempt to understand how i \\'tick\\'. I hate clocks, but i love noise. Time isnt real. I hate the fact that people think you can travel through time, or stop time. Time is just a way to keep track of the decay of carbon based life forms. If you could go back in time, then whenever you accomplished what you set out to do would be completed in the future, and you would have no reason to go back in the first place. If you stopped time, everything would stop moving. Even atoms, hence, you would be imprisoned in a motionless universe. You would suffocate because you wouldnt be able to breathe, better yet move at all. And if you could go into the future, to see what will come to pass, you would then realize that whatever you did in the present didnt matter, because regardless of the \\'choices\\' you would make, it would all lead to the future you saw, leaving you to wonder if you are actually living your life at all, or if you are just a puppet being dragged along by the ever present flow of time. You wouldnt have control of your destiny. Anyways, ive been wondering why i put my \\'friends\\' in the awkward and often times bothersome positions i put them in. I know what causes it, but i cant help it. I need to do these things. But i hate that i cant fulfill that need without hurting someone close to me. I wonder how the lives of my friends would be different, mostly i think of how they would be better if we never had met. How the experiences and provocations i put them through have altered their lives, and how they would be if i had never done those things. I also wonder if when i die, that perhaps the world ceases to exist. That maybe, this world, is dependent on my existence, that the people i know, the places i see are all parts of me, and that when i come to the end of my life, that maybe this world stops. Maybe this world would just vanish, disappear, or if it would just carry on like it seems to when anybody dies. I cant see through somebody else\\'s conciousness, which is why i think that maybe the things i see are here for me, and made by me. Its foolish. I wonder what the world   would be like if i werent alive tomorrow. I wonder if anyone would notice, and if they noticed if they would care, and if they cared if they would remember, and if they remembered would they mourn. If the world keeps spinning after i die, then i wonder what the point of it all was. Ive made little positive impact on the lives of others. I wish i was a better friend. I wish that i am a better friend. I wish that i will be a better friend. If i could, i would go back and fix my mistakes, if i could i would stop the world spinning so i could end the mistakes im making, and if i could i would go to the future and see how ive grown. But i cant. Im here now, only now, never anywhere else. I may never be as good as i think i need to be to completely fulfill what is deserved of my friends as a person, but perhaps ill reach something that is close. Im sorry to those of you who ive made uncomfortable, those of you ive made worry, those of you who ive forced conversation out of. I apologize, it wont happen again. Ill see to that. Time. Time marches on. Time sucks ass. There\\'s not enough time in the world to describe how much my \\'friends\\' mean to me. Not enough time to tell them that they\\'ve done too much. Not enough time to let them know how sorry i am. Either way, its time for me to stop. Its time to better myself. And its time for change.  Song of the Day: Time of Your Life, Green Day Quote of the Day: \"(Silence of sleep)\"',\n",
       " \"The human thought. Always around, ever flowing, constantly inter-twining, filling our temporary filing cabinets with every scrap of information we gather throughout the day. Thoughts are merely images, sounds, ideas, feelings we experience, which are then brought back, and shown to us again as memories. Ghosts of what was, these memories dance inside our heads, keeping the past alive inside, and allowing us to taste what once was, and what has occured throughout our time, our story, that masterpiece of existence that is created by every person on Earth. The quick fleeting glances and shocks of thoughts that race throughout our psyche every moment of our days are all laced together in one fashion or the next. Some think of the mind as a web, or a net, something usually designed for ensnaring something. I think of it as a strand or a beam. Something that begins but does not necessarily end in an exact place. If you've ever sat down, and actually thought about thought, either when you try to remember how you got to the place you are now, and where you started from, you'll realize that everything you ponder is somehow linked, not necesarily intricated with something else, but loosely connected to another. A single word in a quote, or on a sign you recollect may send your thought process onto a whole other current, leading you to something completely different, or perhaps something remarkably similar. In any case, the human brain is exquisite. Any tool that lets something gracefully transition from one thing to the next without the realization of effort, or connection is truly amazing. Something that i believe influences a person's train of thought, quite often de-railing it from its previous track, is music. Music can change a person's entire mood, straight from melancholy to joyous, or from ecstatic to dismal. The melodic anomaly found in everyday sounds and jingles has an effect on people. Traffic noises, sad songs on the radio, crying babies. Anything obnoxious, or unenjoyable can cause a sudden and drastic change in a persons overall demeanor. But mainly, the way a person speaks often tells the listener how the intricate workings of someones mind is functioning. You can fake it all you want, but the tone and texture of the sound flowing from your lips gives it away. The eyes and face help marginally, but the chords of words, or shaky replies more than likely rat out the inner most divinations of the brain. Thinking is so simple, but figuring is difficult. If one is required to solve a problem which hasnt been presented before, the brain must leave all casual thought astray and focus on a single dilema. More often than not, this leads to stress, due to the over exertion of the mind, and the lack of freedom and happiness brought by free thought. The looseness of our thoughts keeps us sane, keeps us happy and relaxed. When a person is resting, they arent focused on something, they're more than likely not thinking about anything in particular, which eases the heart, and nurtures the spirit. Thought. Think about it.   In summation to all of what was just written, whenever you feel stressed, dont just 'relax'. Let your mind wander from the problem for a while, allow your brain to relax. Its not a physical problem as much as it is a mental one. Just think.

       " \"Envy. Lately ive been consumed by it. The want, the urge, no, the need to have what others have, to be as good or better than someone else. Not ambition, not duty, but jealousy and envy. My favorite color always has been green, its really quite ironic. I find myself everyday wishing that i could switch lives/bodies/personalities with my friends and family. To know what its like to be them, to be better than i am, or so i see it. Im not really good at believing in myself, no, its not a strong suit of mine. Im not real big on pride. Thats at least one deadly sin i wont have to worry about. But then again, im not a real good person to refer to on sins. Anyways, i feel jealous, i feel full of want and desire. Desire for something i can never have, its impossible. A desire that will destroy me inside if i dont do anything about it. I must travel to the fires of mount doom..... oh wait, i got a little carried away. Then again, this will be a quest, a personal quest where i must learn to accept myself, and cast Tnilc Nesnah's Bane into the fires. Satron will not take me with his 7, the Singuls, i will carry on. Wow, its early in the morning, im acting stupid. So much Lord of the Rings. I feel so cool, not like a nerd at all, i promise. Anyways, im bored, its time to sleep.

       " 'Yea, its been a while. I dont really care at the moment. At this moment, i just want everybody to know that im extremely happy with most of my friends. And the others, well, they can go straight to a place thats not Heaven. The only reason being is that people randomly get pissed off at me, or have a problem with me, or are annoyed by me, and dont tell me. People block me, then say they didnt block me because they were mad at me, or had a problem with me. What other reason is there, \"Oh, well, i just felt like i needed to block somebody, so i sat down, put everybody\\'s name in a hat, and drew yours, thats my reasoning. Whoops, sorry.\" Yea, its kinda like that. Im not really mad, just confused, i am completely and totally content with my other friends. Jeffrey is back in town, which is cool, Jacob is not, he\\'s on a 2 week cruise of the Meditteranean with his \"poor as dirt on the cheek of a homeless mans face\" family, and many others are yet unacounted for because either they dont call anybody, sleep all day, or are just at home, doing nothing (like me), and arent really in my mind to mention at the moment. I feel kind of rushed right now, rushed for what, who knows, ive been like this a lot lately. My head doesnt hurt. Which is good. Weird stuff isnt happening, which is good. Ive had the chance to hang out with friends, which is good. But i still feel frantic. I know i need to start my summer reading, but i have way too much time for that. Im still applying for a job, and yea, i know i can get one. Its not really an immediate deadline or anything that im concerned with. Its more like a countdown. It might be the countdown to when i graduate, the fact that i might not see some of my best friends ever again. Maybe its the fact that there\\'s been a lot going on in my life, nothing huge, but lots of little things that make me realize that growing up isnt going to be just big huge bundles of 100% grade A quality fun. Money, relationships, work, insurance, bills, credit cards, check books, house payments, car payments, jury duty, parking tickets, heart disease, alzheimers, coffin shopping, will writing. Not a whole lot of that sounds fun to me, so i guess im just feeling frantic because i know my \\'childhood\\', \\'youth\\', \\'teenage years\\', wont last that much longer. Its just a race towards 40. Wow, i dont want to be that old, but yea, i dont want to not make it there either. I dont know really, i feel rushed, but im not doing anything. Ive been sitting around, not really thinking a whole lot, just passing the days. They\\'re going by fast, just like the last 2 years of my life. I cant recall my first day of high school, or the first time i met, or saw some of my current upperclassmen friends of today. My life is a blur, which is natural. Im just weird, i remember really stupid stuff. i remember breaking a glass dish in the kitchen of the first house i lived in when i was 5. I remember hiding under my bed the first time my step dad, ( in that time, only my mothers boyfriend), came to visit. I remember my first bike ride, and how i ran into a station wagon across the street. I remember swimming lessons, oh lord swimming lessons. Im still wondering how that water wasnt boiling, seeing as the DEVIL was the swim instructor. I remember he wouldnt let me out of the pool until i did what he instructed me to, which of course included using the facilities. So naturally, being like 6, i had very poor control over my bodily functions. Enough said. I remember my first pet, my first dog. And for the more uncommon memories, i remember sitting next to a girl in Kindergarten who would always say, \"Move it or lose it.\" I was terrified of that girl. I remember eating lunch with my teacher in a courtyard in 2nd grade because it was a reward in our class, she always brought a huge huge lunch, like steak and fruit, and the best freaking cheesecake ive ever had. I remember the first time I met the girl i would be in love with for 3 years of my life. She knows who she is, and you probably do too. So many memories, but so many lost. I can remember things vaguely, great times i had, but dont immediately recall. I guess i just hope that the things i do now, this year, this high school experience wont end up totally like that. I hope that when i am 40, (eww), that ill remember my friends, and maybe even call them up every so often. I hope that a lot of things happen, i should stop. Things dont get done just from hoping, so i need to take action more often. I feel ok. I am ok. I just am confused as to why im in a hurry, and why my friends dont tell me whats bothering them. Thats all ive got for now. Im gonna go do nothing, and still be rushed.  Song of the Day: Nightingale, Saves the Day Quote of the Day: \"Go Cavs Fo Sheezy\", Cassie and Emily',\n",

       " 'The sun has just set, leaving tinges of purple and indigo spread thin across the night sky. A mournful finality grips the land as another day dies and passes on, while a promise of a new day chases the emotions created by the waxing moon and gently sparkling stars. The cosmic events leading up to a sunset are incredible. As the earth gently glides throughout the universe, making slow revolutions around our most familiar star, the people living upon it never question or ponder what exactly is occuring in order to allow them to live their lives, see their family, be with friends, or to just be alive at all. People rely on the days to pass, even though they complain about how time flies. Sunsets are romantic, they bring people joy and despair at the same time. Darkness without light is frightening, but a midnight with a loved one is anything but. The pallet of colors cast brilliantly across the night sky as the sun grows dim is breathtaking. Pastels of life and love and happiness fill the minds of those who look upon the cascade of shades and hues on the horizon. A day without a sunset would be too depressing, if the day were as a light switch, simply from light to dark, then many would despair. Its the gentle transition from bright and luminous, to a serene and gentle canvas of violet that allows people to reflect, remember, and relax. A friend of mine gave me my inspiration through a beautiful image of such an event. Clouds cascading over one another as dancing rays of orange and red leaped across a lake. \"These are such things that dreams are made of,\" seems to sum it up well. I feel poetic, even though my ramblings often seem jumbled or muttled. I wish i was eloquent, worthy of remembrance for my oftentimes delusional literary creations.

Think of the people you\\'ve affected throughout the day, and dream about what could yet come to pass in the future. Imagine yourself at your greatest, and try with all your might to reach that point in the following day. Be great. Be amazing. Be who you are. Be.

Im not a big fan of reflection, but i think that rememberance is ok. I dont like putting emphasis on certain days, because then, that in turn almost forces people to think about the tragedy, and remember more than is necessary, and more often than not, memorial days cause victims to relive the trauma they endured. People should mourn, people should pray if you\\'re into that, and people should remember, but people should move on, and maybe even someday learn to put the tragic thoughts away and every so often, think about it, without spending an entire day of memories and pain.

Its just a suggestion. I guess i would be corrupted too if i dated somebody who looked like they just got back from a photo shoot for a gushers commercial.  No quotes worth putting.

       " 'Ah, the journal. This simple expression of inner thought. I dont really understand the appeal of writing in it, but there is definately an appeal. I deleted the past 2 entries i wrote. I find them outdated and depressing. If you must see them, i might show them to you, but oh well, the past is the past. Im starting over, and i really like the way things are now. Im glad that the people that i call friends are such forgiving people, and are completely amazing for making their decision. But enough about the tedious workings of my life. I feel inspired. Again. This time not to write a masterpiece, or to talk about what i think, but to just write. To just say what will flow from my fingertips. To write what comes to my hands, as they glide across the wireless keyboard of my soul. I think its great that things are going well for everyone. Everyone, basically is happy, and thats with little exception for the first time in a while. I think its amazing that i can be with and around the people i am all the time. And i hope that i can bring somebody else that i think is really special into that group. Im glad that the sun rises every morning, and im glad that it will continue to do so even after im gone, (at least for the next 80 billion years...). But yea, high school is coming to a close for some of the fantastic people that i have become aquainted to, and i feel that i will miss them more than i think. It wont be keller without them, and it could quite possibly be more boring than ever. When people leave, this town dies a little. Its not a real town to me, its more like a collection. Its just a story of people. Its an anthology of lives. Nothing happens here, in this village, but there\\'s always something to do. I find that fascinating. Ah, Toby is not rugged anymore, and my mom finished my blanket. Its really quite neat. Toby is clean, and i am warm, things are going well. I find that when i write for pleasure, its......... pleasureable, but when i write for zell, its....... not. I cant seem to express myself when i write for a prompt or an assignment. Here, i can say what i wish, without fear of grade or censor, and i dont have to worry about being ridiculed for my expression. Hmmm, i dont really have anything to write about, but just writing makes me smile. Smiling is good, and ive missed it.   Im making a cd for buddy, and i get an excuse to download some great music for her. I also made $100 for selling my old decrepit laptop. Today was good. I played computer games with jeff, and it took forever.   I feel fragmented, but then again, the passage of time this weekend has felt irregular. I wonder why. Maybe the planets are in alignment, or i can sense the leap day, but either way, i feel like ive been stretched. I like the feeling. I feel like there\\'s more time. So im happy. Generally and genuinely happy. I talked to a cool kid the other night who said that he read this for a while, and that it moved him. I dont know if thats true or not, i dont see how it could be, i mean, im not that inspirational, but it prompted me to start this up again. Im not going to change the way i write, but im going to change my outlook.  Insight into my life is all that this offers to others, but to me, it offers an unquestioning ear. It offers understanding and comprehension of all my subtle metaphors, and all of my gentle allusions. I really think that i get too deep in it sometimes, Ms. Zell didnt catch them in my narrative. That made me sad, but im going to talk to her about it. She\\'s going to let me try again. I just hope that ill get another muse. I loved that paper, but it was difficult to grasp. I understand that. Hmmm, maybe ill post it sometime. If anybody wants to see it. I havent had anybody read it but Ms. Zell, and myself, so, i guess it should be shared eventually.  I like long posts, but im surprised that you\\'ve stayed reading this far. Its just rambling above. But now i think ill say something meaningful. I think ill say that i enjoy it when my glass is full. I enjoy seeing things half full, even when its apparent that they\\'re half empty. Deliriously oblivious, i have promenaded through the weeks, and made myself aquainted to the sounds of relaxation.   I hope to be trendy tomorrow, i hope to be stylish. Because Cassie and Emily helped me pick stuff out.   Listen to Hoobastank, \"The Reason\" \"You\\'re like my inhaler, I just can\\'t breathe without you.\"  Thanks for the interest.',\n",
       " \"I guess im just a hopeless romantic, but im growing weary of this loneliness. I thought i found somebody that i could confide in, but i was wrong i guess. I feel dumb for letting myself get down over stupid things like this. I feel ridiculous for getting upset for never being kissed. I feel like an 8 year old. I just want to experience what everyone else has. I want to 'fit in', yea, i want that, even though its 'evil' and 'pressuring', it still lets you relate. Being separated or segregated from a group in your head makes you feel differently. I had hope that things would change for a while. Turns out it was just my own naive ideals that crushed my hopes. I keep telling myself im doing something wrong. I keep telling myself that im not doing something right. I know thats wrong, but thats all I can determine. I want someone i can be close to. Someone i can be with and be comfortable. I want a person to know what im thinking, and to care about what i have to say. I want somebody who, when im talking, isnt just waiting for their turn to speak. I want somebody who gives up their turn to listen.  I want to be wanted.\",\n",
       " 'Hmmm, today was interesting. I was either heading to, or coming from, a PETsMART 8 times today. Toby needed a haircut, and now he looks goofy, so i had to drop him off, then come home, then go get him. Then, i was going to apply there with Emily, but she wasnt going to make the 1:00 time, so i was practically there, so i turned around and went to her house for a bit. Then we went to the post office, with the 1 human attendant, and mailed a piece of postage and spied an awesome little resturant. Afterward, we headed to a different PETsMART to finally apply at 2:00, and arrived at 1:50. Ok, here\\'s where the fun starts.  Mr. Manager, (we never learn his name), greets us at the door after the cashier, (probably my future job if im accepted), calls for him, and he takes us back to the staff room thing to watch an awesome movie. The movie\\'s first 20 seconds consist of the camera zooming in on the stupid ball that bounces off of the \\'s\\' on the PETsMART sign, which makes it lower case for some reason. The movie is really corny, and gives me the message that if you don\\'t wear your name tag to work, you\\'ll end up killing all of the hamsters or fish or something because \\'if you dont complete all of your tasks here, you may be endangering the lives of pets.\\' Yea, so, i suppressed my laughter the best i could, (as did Emily), and i made it throught the video. Halfway through the video, at about 2:00 exactly, another applicant, we\\'ll call him \"Late Guy\" walks in. Despite the fact that he\\'s the only puntcual one of all 3 of us, he still appears late, which forces Mr. Manager to replay the video for him. The incesant smiling of the host guy in the video droned on in my head as i began to tackle the arduous task of compiling the huge sum of unnecessary information required for the completion of a gigantic application repeating over and over that, in simpler words, \\'Drugs are bad, you\\'ll get fired if you use drugs.\\'   Anyways, after the video and application phases, the next, more embarrassing part of the application process began. Mr. Manager took us one at a time into his office to ask us job-related questions. I, of course being the first to finish the application due to the time saved by avoiding having to write down any previous employment locations, was served first with a barrage of very vague and confusing questions/activities. I have hereby branded myself with the title, \"New Guy\", due to my lack of job experience. He takes me into his office, and the first words he says are, \"So, this could be your first job.\" Wow, um, yea, it will be, and for the sake of it, we couldve stopped there probably. Oh no, the fun went on. Ok, here goes, tell me how you wouldve responded to this. \"OK, we\\'re going to do some role-playing, ill be a customer, and you be the associate. I\\'m in the leash aisle, how would you approach me,\" says Mr. Manager. Hmmmm, uhhhh, hello sir, can i help you......? Anyways, you get the picture, it went on for a while, and i stumble through it, and he tells me what i couldve done better. Eh, more vague questions came afterward, i answered them with help from my encounters with some of Murtagh\\'s questions, and did my best with those. Me, \"New Guy\", had finished.  Emily\\'s turn comes. She says that she made herself sound really dumb. Mr. Manager seemed to have an extra skill in that area that few have. She says that she responded several times with phrases like, \"I love animals,\" or, \"I like rats and fish and.....\" Yea, we all had a good laugh. It was quite funny. So then she labeled herself \"Ditsy Girl\". She had questions like, \"How would you rate teamwork on a scale of 1 to 10?\", and thats all. Its kinda like, \"Hmmm, lets see here, How? on a scale of 1 to 10.\" So the questions were broad.  We both know \"Late Guy\" got a job, hands down. He seemed like he didnt give a damn, so he\\'s in. But i think its a battle between \"I love animals,\" and \"I have no job experience.\" I really dont know who will win. I mean, i might be shelling out change to people buying dog sweaters next week, who knows, or Emily might be working in the fish section, because she really doesnt want to work in the equine section at all. Eh, it was fun/hilarious, and afterward there was some good food. You should all go out and apply for random jobs. The only thing is, you might get one. Wouldnt that suck. Eww, work. The rest of the day consisted of usual teenage hanging out, and the watching of many music videos. All in all, a good day. Now, its getting kinda late, not really, but eh, and i need to decide which bed is closest and easiest to dive on to before i fall asleep in this chair. Im lazy, but maybe soon, a working man.

Only a few things are bothering me. Maybe just one, and it starts with \"M\" and ryhmes with Nurtagh. She gave us this enormous  ass ignment over the break. I really dont like that woman. But whatever, she wont ruin my break. Maybe ill figure out this person ive been so confused with. I hope so. Eh. Some things have been brewing for a while, and they finally erupted. Everybody knew they would, i just hope things are resolved quickly. My dad\\'s house was really close to the area that the people on the news are talking about. The damaged houses on the news are about 5 miles from my dads house. I hope he\\'s ok. I love my dad. A lot. He lives by the lake, a lake that should be visited by my friends this summer. Visited before they leave for college, or get ready for the upcoming school year. Yea, that\\'d be grand. I have to turn in my schedule tomorrow, but im afraid to take \"Adolf Whitler.\" I really am afraid of that class. Im writing a definition paper for Zell that hopefully she wont despise like she has my others. Im really putting a lot of effort into it. I already have an outline, and i have planned to write a draft of it every 3 days. It will be excellent, or else. Im so tired of school right now. I have to study for Zell\\'s test, because i need to do well to raise my terrible average. I need to do well so she will not hate me as much.   Alison Fudge, (a truly awesome chica), gave me a copy of her hoobastank cd. Ive listened to The Reason about 15 times in the past 2 days. Its so beautiful. Kinda reminds me of..... Anyways, i like it when it rains. I dont like walking in the rain with an umbrella, i feel like im trying to defy nature. I remember sprinting through the driving rain in florida with my friends last summer. Thats where i really got to know Emily and Cassie. They\\'re really great friends. Truly great. Im glad i got to learn about them that trip, and i think it was an interesting experience with the whole extreme trouble action. Yay for hidden theme park attractions in Canada. With Canadians.  Yea, i think the rain is peaceful. Even if it is torrential. It washes my worries away. I feel like the rain fills that glass that people label optimists or pesimists with. It makes me optimistic. I look blindly at things, and always see hope when it rains. I love the rain. I wish i lived in seattle. Maybe not, but it was a thought.

       " \"I would like to request some inspiration, as odd as that sounds. I want to hear from people, their comments, opinions, anything, about anything. I would love to just take in their thoughts for a while, so i can try and unwind from my own anticipations and anxieties about life. I'm delieriously happy now, all the time. I love my friends so much, they are by far the most influential and wonderful parts of my life. I wake up everyday, and hope that i get to see them and talk and laugh like always. It fills me with glee to know that ill have at least one more summer with all of them, and I'm even more glad to get to know somebody i think is very special. Please, tell me what you're thinking. Tell me how you feel, and give me some insight into your life. I'll make this an ongoing thing, something that i believe can be something that i could be very proud of. I just really want to live with other people. I feel more alive when people are around, they complete my character and motivate my soul to shine.  Just talk. Release your thoughts through words. You dont have to partake in this excersise of communication, but if you have anything at all that you find interesting or important, please share. I think of this journal as something to help unleash my creativity from time to time. I love some of my previous entries more than anything ive written, because they're real. They're free-flowing thought, something that cant be taught or developed. It just occurs naturally and oftentimes results in some of the greatest art in the world. Think and speak and share and communicate, its the only way to introduce the world to the beauty of your life.  On a side note, I absolutely love Tina Fey, my car, dancing when nobody's watching, eating things that would make Dr. McReynolds cringe, being with my bestest of friends, making fun of dumb people, and realizing things about myself. I love these things. I love living so much, and have for a while now. Things used to be so different, but things change, like all things do. So i dont expect this bliss to be permanent by any means, but i do want to embrace it while i can. Tell me things you love. Off the wall things. Things you didnt even realize until you sat and thought about it. Just tell me.  I would like for this to become something amazing. Like a compilation or memoir of all the people i know. A literary memory of our friendships, regardless of how in depth they are. If you think this is stupid, tell me, thats still a thought, and still an opinion that should be expressed. I love long posts. I know somebody else who does also. They've told me so.  Summer should be tomorrow, it really should. Id get to experience so much more if i were free all the time. I want to learn so much. I want to see and taste and feel more this summer than any other, and i want it to last much much longer. I want to be with my seniors, the seniors ive grown so close to that i take for granted the pleasure of seeing and conversing with nearly everyday. But they're going through their own set of worries. College and what not, and the moving away ordeal. It must be hard. I really want them to be happy, they're amazing people. Meet them.   Let a stream of moonlight fill your sight with intuition, and let yourself foresee your own happiness. Bask in the rays of your own ecstasy and realize that you're living for you. Make a time be your own, and dont be afraid to embrace a moment. Take part of your life, and dont let it take control of you. You're in control of your own destiny, and the paths you take will lead you where you wanted to go. During your journey, keep gazing skyward, to remember the past, and look beyond to your future. Keep your spirits high, and raise those of others to your level whenever possible. I want to bottle some moonlight sometimes, just to shine on people when they're not as inspired as I.  If any of this makes sense to anybody, then im glad that somebody understands what im thinking. If not, then tell me your interpretation, its yet another form of expression, analyzation, and thought.  I really didnt expect to write anything tonight of any real significance, but now, im quite happy with whats come to me.  Listen to something that makes you smile.

       " 'Hmmm, so im sitting here, thinking to myself, what is something interesting to put in here. Well, ive thought about it for a while, and had some okay ideas, so i think ill just start writing, and see what develops. Here goes...  I played freeze tag with small children a while back at my dad\\'s house in Acton, Texas. Afterward, (several hours afterward i might add), i thought about how every step in human development has its own common desire. I became aware of the fact that kids do whatever is in their power to make games last forever. While playing freeze tag, the kids started cheating in order to keep the game going. I played freeze tag, as \"It\", for 2 hours straight without finishing a game. I came to the conclusion that the first stage of human life never wants the game to end. The game that is life. The unfolding adventure of each new day, and any misadventures that occur along the way.   Later, i realized that the second phase of development is the phase im currently a part of. The adolescent, pre-adulthood, teenage years. I know that all of us have thought about leaving our hometowns at least once a day, every day, for the past several years. How you\\'ll miss your friends, the people you\\'ve spent your childhoods with, your favorite times together alongside, and your hardest times working through with. I read my last post just a moment ago, and saw how desperately i wanted to be done with school, but i remember, at the same time, i  dreaded the fact that it was another step in the direction of dispersion. The friends that i will inevitably part from, and yes, possibly forget one day, are what keep me sane and alive every day. I decided that teenagers never want their \\'lives\\' to end. They never want to leave what they\\'ve grown so accustomed to, and what they seem to grow in to. The possibility of a different, possibly less pleasurable, possibly more difficult prospect of life after high school and college is something that people like me want to keep at bay. I want these years to never end.  Although i havent experienced the next phases myself, ive gathered enough experience with people of these classes to be able to formulate ideas on them. People in there twenties and thirties, for the sake of classification, lets call them \\'youths\\' as it were, despite their age in comparison to my, or possibly your age, seem to treasure just that, their youth, above anything else. The ability to play, run, jump, drink, smoke, dive, swing, swim, and sex with no regard to the consequences is the drug of choice to the people in this class. The fact that their bodies are still capable of everything they could in the teen years, and the fact that they\\'re adults and of expanded experience, creates something that is precious, a sort of limited opportunity for bliss. I see the main fear of these people as the process of aging. I think that the \\'youths\\' never want their youth to end. They want to stay as virile and agile and mobile as they can for as long as they can. They want to stop the clock.  Mid-life crisis survivors and other middle aged people are the next classification. The fact that they\\'re not a \\'youth\\' anymore encroaches on their minds as their years accumulate. They buy expensive objects in hope of appeasing the need for their youthfulness, and explore new endeavors in hopes of drowning out the memories of their past. The inevitability of decrepitude begins to haunt their dreams. Middle-aged people never want their health to leave them. They want their youth returned, and their vigor restored. They want the clock to turn back.  The ancients, the elders, the decrepit, the geezers. They spend the rest of their days reflecting on their lives. Their experiences, their thoughts, their ideas, and their loves. They tell the youngsters stories of when they themselves were young, while often their tales fall on bored ears. The idea of youth is gone, and the fear of death and the realization that it could be close at hand is ever present. The elderly wish for their memories to sustain them, and their offspring to remember them. They want the clock to keep ticking.  I love writing, as you probably have guessed. But i also love feedback, be it positive or negative. I like to observe, i like to interact, and i like to experience. I wish i could say something deep in here, but i just write down what i feel.   I want to go see Dodgeball and Anchorman with somebody. They know who they are. I will break them out of their house if their parents wont let them.  There\\'s only two songs on my mind tonight, Masque for one, its the only song i whistle at least once a day, and Roxeanne, the Moulin Rouge version, because \"its so powerful.\"  Write something down whenever you get the chance, itll brighten your day. By the way, now you can leave comments on any of my posts, it would make my day if you left some, and remember, i can delete the ones that are stupid. So if you\\'re stupid, dont bother leaving a comment. ~Clint',\n",

       " u'Kunal Kohli\\'s second offering (his first was Mujhse Dosti Karoge), Yash Raj Films\\' HumTum is a simple love story. It is the essential Bollywood formula love story, with a twist: Girl meets boy. Girl hates boy. Girl meets boy again. They fall in love.  The film opens at the airport with the protagonists, Karan Kapoor (Saif Ali Khan) and Rhea Prakash (Rani Mukherjee), leaving for New York. Rhea\\'s mother, Parminder Prakash aka Bobby (Kirron Kher), is busy praying for her daughter\\'s safety.  Karan is accompanied by mom Anu Kapoor (Rati Agnihotri) and good friend Mihir Vora (Jimmy Shergill). He believes that \\'boys\\' and \\'girls\\' can never understand each other, let alone be friends.  Both Karan and Rhea are seated next to each other in the aircraft, and the ice is broken. Karan shows Rhea his cartoon characters, Hum and Tum, the quintessential boy and girl who cannot live with or without each other!  At a stopover in Amsterdam, they explore the city and their differences together. Just as Rhea drops her guard around Karan, he kisses her, only to be slapped. They part on that sour note.  Three months later, they bump into each other at a New York park. Karan is with his girlfriend Shalini (Shenaz Treasurywala). Shalini and Rhea discover they are school friends. Rhea tells Shalini all about the Amsterdam episode, at the end of which Karan and Shalini split.  Cut to three months later, when Karan is back in Delhi with his mother. She is a wedding coordinator and ropes Karan in to help with a wedding. The bride turns out to be Rhea.  Karan bumps into Rhea again on a French train, where she cryptically tells him, \"Samir is no longer part of my life.\" Karan lands up at his father\\'s (Rishi Kapoor) Parisian house and tries to find Rhea.  Will Karan find Rhea? Where is Samir? Will they realise that they love each other? Will they be together? This constitutes the rest of film.  Hum and Tum, Karan\\'s cartoon characters, pop up now and again. They experience the incidents that happen to Karan and Rhea \\u2014 in animation.  This urban romance, which spans six years and many cities \\u2014 Amsterdam, New York, Paris, Delhi and Mumbai \\u2014 is an easy watch. The movie is essentially episodic in nature, and the episodes have been woven well together. The characters are also well defined.  There is a plausible, if simplistic, storyline. Like when Rhea alights from the train, she doesn\\'t give Karan either her number or her address. Karan still traces her phone number and reaches her mother.  The film does suffer from continuity problems. At her mehendi ceremony, Rhea dances around Karan in the Gore gore song. The mehendi in alternate scenes changes from wet, dark green to light orange to dark orange. The next scene shows Rhea\\'s forearm covered in a dark maroon mehendi design, but the palm is clean.  In the beginning of another scene, Karan is shown to be drunk and tottering around. All of a sudden, he finds his balance, walks straight, and is so sober that he proceeds to run and find a victoria and come back to where Rani is waiting.  Also, it isn\\'t quite clear why Karan and Rhea do give up their inhibitions. Why would a girl who is so independent get close to a guy she is not sure of?  But Kunal Kohli does a fair job. The direction is tight in most places. The title song, though, is placed badly and detracts from the narrative. It can be safely deleted from the movie.  Saif is perfect for the role as Karan, the smooth-talking urban male whose main aim in life is to get every woman to date him. In fact, this role would be a natural progression to his Dil Chahata Hai role. The film rests on his shoulders. From the irresponsible 22 year-old off to America, his character has been developed well over the next six years in the movie. As usual, Saif scores with his comic timing.  Rani continues with her Chalte Chalte tanned look for this film. She has done a competent job as the level-headed, no-nonsense Punjabi girl who knows what she wants. She excels in the tear-jerking scenes and matches Saif in the comic ones.  Kirron Kher as Rhea\\'s mother is superb, with her Punjabi accent and mannerisms. The other supporting actors, Rishi Kapoor, Rati Agnihotri, Jimmy Shergill, and Ishaa Koppikar, are adequate.  All told, a feel-good film which will appeal to urban audiences.',\n",

I thought the injury to Monaco's captain in the first half hit them really hard and their top players did not perform to the occasion.   Well as far as the rest of the day is concerned, waited and waited for Himanshu (friend from school) to turn up ... but he did not come ..... Really i am very angry as he made me get up early in the morning ( 9 am :(( ) and then i was sitting like a fool expecting him :(   Anyway .. tommorrow hopefully i will get a second telephone line, and then be able to be online practically 24X7 ......

Well the journey was a story in itself.  A fairly long story actually. I had my train reservation frm my home town Jhansi. I missed the train by just 5 min on Saturday morning. What followed was nothing less than a Bollywood blockbuster ( ok ..... a lot less than that ... but still a lot :) ) A had to catch a bus to Kanpur, ... spent 5 hours in the heat and humidity of Bundelkhand as the rickety bus travelled to Kanpur. The other ticket that i had got after missing my train was not confirmed, i had been waitlisted at number 13. Well ... i found out that my status then was number 8, but had no chances of getting confirmed. Now i had to urgently reach Calcutta to deposit the fees, so ... i bribed a coolie on the station ..( well it seems to me that the job of coolies at Kanpur station is not to carry the luggage of passengers ... but rather to \"help\" poor fellows like me in getting a berth in the train they want ( of course after charging a hefty fees:) ) ) I had to pay the fellow 100 bucks .... then the ticket collector another 500 bucks over the fare diffrence between 2 AC and 3 AC ........ 1100 bucks down the drain :( just for the delay of 5 min ... can u imagine.   Anyway the rest of the journey was fine ..... did not have to experience the heat .... I tried to take a look out of the window during the travel ... but was really shocked by the state of affairs in Bihar ... villages on the track side seemed to be straight out of some old age movie with thacthed roofs and all .. .did not think that there was as backward a place as Bihar.

       " 'Remarks by Al Gore May 26, 2004 As Prepared  George W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility. Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world.  He promised to \"restore honor and integrity to the White House.\" Instead, he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.  Honor? He decided not to honor the Geneva Convention. Just as he would not honor the United Nations, international treaties, the opinions of our allies, the role of Congress and the courts, or what Jefferson described as \"a decent respect for the opinion of mankind.\" He did not honor the advice, experience and judgment of our military leaders in designing his invasion of Iraq. And now he will not honor our fallen dead by attending any funerals or even by permitting photos of their flag-draped coffins.  How did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words \"We Are All Americans Now\" and when we had the good will and empathy of all the world -- to the horror that we all felt in witnessing the pictures of torture in Abu Ghraib.  To begin with, from its earliest days in power, this administration sought to radically destroy the foreign policy consensus that had guided America since the end of World War II. The long successful strategy of containment was abandoned in favor of the new strategy of \"preemption.\" And what they meant by preemption was not the inherent right of any nation to act preemptively against an imminent threat to its national security, but rather an exotic new approach that asserted a unique and unilateral U.S. right to ignore international law wherever it wished to do so and take military action against any nation, even in circumstances where there was no imminent threat. All that is required, in the view of Bush\\'s team is the mere assertion of a possible, future threat - and the assertion need be made by only one person, the President.  More disturbing still was their frequent use of the word \"dominance\" to describe their strategic goal, because an American policy of dominance is as repugnant to the rest of the world as the ugly dominance of the helpless, naked Iraqi prisoners has been to the American people. Dominance is as dominance does.  Dominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain. And as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul.  One of the clearest indications of the impending loss of intimacy with one\\'s soul is the failure to recognize the existence of a soul in those over whom power is exercised, especially if the helpless come to be treated as animals, and degraded. We also know - and not just from De Sade and Freud - the psychological proximity between sexual depravity and other people\\'s pain. It has been especially shocking and awful to see these paired evils perpetrated so crudely and cruelly in the name of America.  Those pictures of torture and sexual abuse came to us embedded in a wave of news about escalating casualties and growing chaos enveloping our entire policy in Iraq. But in order understand the failure of our overall policy, it is important to focus specifically on what happened in the Abu Ghraib prison, and ask whether or not those actions were representative of who we are as Americans? Obviously the quick answer is no, but unfortunately it\\'s more complicated than that.  There is good and evil in every person. And what makes the United States special in the history of nations is our commitment to the rule of law and our carefully constructed system of checks and balances. Our natural distrust of concentrated power and our devotion to openness and democracy are what have lead us as a people to consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people any other nation.  Our founders were insightful students of human nature. They feared the abuse of power because they understood that every human being has not only \"better angels\" in his nature, but also an innate vulnerability to temptation - especially the temptation to abuse power over others.  Our founders understood full well that a system of checks and balances is needed in our constitution because every human being lives with an internal system of checks and balances that cannot be relied upon to produce virtue if they are allowed to attain an unhealthy degree of power over their fellow citizens.  Listen then to the balance of internal impulses described by specialist Charles Graner when confronted by one of his colleagues, Specialist Joseph M. Darby, who later became a courageous whistleblower. When Darby asked him to explain his actions documented in the photos, Graner replied: \"The Christian in me says it\\'s wrong, but the Corrections Officer says, \\'I love to make a groan man piss on himself.\"  What happened at the prison, it is now clear, was not the result of random acts by \"a few bad apples,\" it was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy that has dismantled those wise constraints and has made war on America\\'s checks and balances.  The abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the Administration\\'s march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of September 11th.  There was then, there is now and there would have been regardless of what Bush did, a threat of terrorism that we would have to deal with. But instead of making it better, he has made it infinitely worse. We are less safe because of his policies. He has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years of our existence as a nation -- because of his attitude of contempt for any person, institution or nation who disagrees with him.  He has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet\\'s nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us. And by then insulting the religion and culture and tradition of people in other countries. And by pursuing policies that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children, all of it done in our name.  President Bush said in his speech Monday night that the war in Iraq is \"the central front in the war on terror.\" It\\'s not the central front in the war on terror, but it has unfortunately become the central recruiting office for terrorists. [Dick Cheney said, \"This war may last the rest of our lives.] The unpleasant truth is that President Bush\\'s utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and dramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States. Just yesterday, the International Institute of Strategic Studies reported that the Iraq conflict \" has arguable focused the energies and resources of Al Qaeda and its followers while diluting those of the global counterterrorism coalition.\" The ISS said that in the wake of the war in Iraq Al Qaeda now has more than 18,000 potential terrorists scattered around the world and the war in Iraq is swelling its ranks.  The war plan was incompetent in its rejection of the advice from military professionals and the analysis of the intelligence was incompetent in its conclusion that our soldiers would be welcomed with garlands of flowers and cheering crowds. Thus we would not need to respect the so-called Powell doctrine of overwhelming force.  There was also in Rumsfeld\\'s planning a failure to provide security for nuclear materials, and to prevent widespread lawlessness and looting.  Luckily, there was a high level of competence on the part of our soldiers even though they were denied the tools and the numbers they needed for their mission. What a disgrace that their families have to hold bake sales to buy discarded Kevlar vests to stuff into the floorboards of the Humvees! Bake sales for body armor.  And the worst still lies ahead. General Joseph Hoar, the former head of the Marine Corps, said \"I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss.\"  When a senior, respected military leader like Joe Hoar uses the word \"abyss\", then the rest of us damn well better listen. Here is what he means: more American soldiers dying, Iraq slipping into worse chaos and violence, no end in sight, with our influence and moral authority seriously damaged.  Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, who headed Central Command before becoming President Bush\\'s personal emissary to the Middle East, said recently that our nation\\'s current course is \"headed over Niagara Falls.\"  The Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, Army Major General Charles H. Swannack, Jr., asked by the Washington Post whether he believes the United States is losing the war in Iraq, replied, \"I think strategically, we are.\" Army Colonel Paul Hughes, who directed strategic planning for the US occupation authority in Baghdad, compared what he sees in Iraq to the Vietnam War, in which he lost his brother: \"I promised myself when I came on active duty that I would do everything in my power to prevent that ... from happening again. \" Noting that Vietnam featured a pattern of winning battles while losing the war, Hughes added \"unless we ensure that we have coherence in our policy, we will lose strategically.\"  The White House spokesman, Dan Bartlett was asked on live television about these scathing condemnations by Generals involved in the highest levels of Pentagon planning and he replied, \"Well they\\'re retired, and we take our advice from active duty officers.\"  But amazingly, even active duty military officers are speaking out against President Bush. For example, the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior General at the Pentagon as saying, \" the current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) refused to listen or adhere to military advice.\" Rarely if ever in American history have uniformed commanders felt compelled to challenge their commander in chief in public.  The Post also quoted an unnamed general as saying, \"Like a lot of senior Army guys I\\'m quite angry\" with Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush Administration. He listed two reasons. \"I think they are going to break the Army,\" he said, adding that what really incites him is \"I don\\'t think they care.\"  In his upcoming book, Zinni blames the current catastrophe on the Bush team\\'s incompetence early on. \"In the lead-up to the Iraq war, and its later conduct,\" he writes, \"I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption.\"  Zinni\\'s book will join a growing library of volumes by former advisors to Bush -- including his principal advisor on terrorism, Richard Clarke; his principal economic policy advisor, former Treasury Secretary Paul O\\'Neill, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who was honored by Bush\\'s father for his service in Iraq, and his former Domestic Adviser on faith-based organizations, John Dilulio, who said, \"There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one: a complete lack of a policy apparatus. What you\\'ve got is everything, and I mean everything, run by the political arm. It\\'s the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis.\"  Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki told Congress in February that the occupation could require \"several hundred thousand troops.\" But because Rumsfeld and Bush did not want to hear disagreement with their view that Iraq could be invaded at a much lower cost, Shinseki was hushed and then forced out.  And as a direct result of this incompetent plan and inadequate troop strength, young soldiers were put in an untenable position. For example, young reservists assigned to the Iraqi prisons were called up without training or adequate supervision, and were instructed by their superiors to \"break down\" prisoners in order to prepare them for interrogation.  To make matters worse, they were placed in a confusing situation where the chain of command was criss-crossed between intelligence gathering and prison administration, and further confused by an unprecedented mixing of military and civilian contractor authority.  The soldiers who are accused of committing these atrocities are, of course, responsible for their own actions and if found guilty, must be severely and appropriately punished. But they are not the ones primarily responsible for the disgrace that has been brought upon the United States of America.  Private Lynndie England did not make the decision that the United States would not observe the Geneva Convention. Specialist Charles Graner was not the one who approved a policy of establishing an American Gulag of dark rooms with naked prisoners to be \"stressed\" and even - we must use the word - tortured - to force them to say things that legal procedures might not induce them to say.  These policies were designed and insisted upon by the Bush White House. Indeed, the President\\'s own legal counsel advised him specifically on the subject. His secretary of defense and his assistants pushed these cruel departures from historic American standards over the objections of the uniformed military, just as the Judge Advocates General within the Defense Department were so upset and opposed that they took the unprecedented step of seeking help from a private lawyer in this city who specializes in human rights and said to him, \"There is a calculated effort to create an atmosphere of legal ambiguity\" where the mistreatment of prisoners is concerned.\"  Indeed, the secrecy of the program indicates an understanding that the regular military culture and mores would not support these activities and neither would the American public or the world community. Another implicit acknowledgement of violations of accepted standards of behavior is the process of farming out prisoners to countries less averse to torture and giving assignments to private contractors  President Bush set the tone for our attitude for suspects in his State of the Union address. He noted that more than 3,000 \"suspected terrorists\" had been arrested in many countries and then he added, \"and many others have met a different fate. Let\\'s put it this way: they are no longer a problem to the United States and our allies.\"  George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.  How dare the incompetent and willful members of this Bush/Cheney Administration humiliate our nation and our people in the eyes of the world and in the conscience of our own people. How dare they subject us to such dishonor and disgrace. How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein\\'s torture prison.  David Kay concluded his search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq with the famous verdict: \"we were all wrong.\" And for many Americans, Kay\\'s statement seemed to symbolize the awful collision between Reality and all of the false and fading impressions President Bush had fostered in building support for his policy of going to war.  Now the White House has informed the American people that they were also \"all wrong\" about their decision to place their faith in Ahmed Chalabi, even though they have paid him 340,000 dollars per month. 33 million dollars (CHECK) and placed him adjacent to Laura Bush at the State of the Union address. Chalabi had been convicted of fraud and embezzling 70 million dollars in public funds from a Jordanian bank, and escaped prison by fleeing the country. But in spite of that record, he had become one of key advisors to the Bush Administration on planning and promoting the War against Iraq.  And they repeatedly cited him as an authority, perhaps even a future president of Iraq. Incredibly, they even ferried him and his private army into Baghdad in advance of anyone else, and allowed him to seize control over Saddam\\'s secret papers.  Now they are telling the American people that he is a spy for Iran who has been duping the President of the United States for all these years.  One of the Generals in charge of this war policy went on a speaking tour in his spare time to declare before evangelical groups that the US is in a holy war as \"Christian Nation battling Satan.\" This same General Boykin was the person who ordered the officer who was in charge of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay to extend his methods to Iraq detainees, prisoners. ... The testimony from the prisoners is that they were forced to curse their religion Bush used the word \"crusade\" early on in the war against Iraq, and then commentators pointed out that it was singularly inappropriate because of the history and sensitivity of the Muslim world and then a few weeks later he used it again.  \"We are now being viewed as the modern Crusaders, as the modern colonial power in this part of the world,\" Zinni said.  What a terrible irony that our country, which was founded by refugees seeking religious freedom - coming to America to escape domineering leaders who tried to get them to renounce their religion - would now be responsible for this kind of abuse..  Ameen Saeed al-Sheikh told the Washington Post that he was tortured and ordered to denounce Islam and after his leg was broken one of his torturers started hitting it while ordering him to curse Islam and then, \" they ordered me to thank Jesus that I\\'m alive.\" Others reported that they were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol.  In my religious tradition, I have been taught that \"ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.\"  The President convinced a majority of the country that Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacking us on September 11th. But in truth he had nothing whatsoever to do with it. The President convinced the country with a mixture of forged documents and blatantly false assertions that Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda, and that he was \"indistinguishable\" from Osama bin Laden.  He asked the nation , in his State of the Union address, to \"imagine\" how terrified we should be that Saddam was about to give nuclear weapons to terrorists and stated repeatedly that Iraq posed a grave and gathering threat to our nation. He planted the seeds of war, and harvested a whirlwind. And now, the \"corrupt tree\" of a war waged on false premises has brought us the \"evil fruit\" of Americans torturing and humiliating prisoners.  In my opinion, John Kerry is dealing with this unfolding tragedy in an impressive and extremely responsible way. Our nation\\'s best interest lies in having a new president who can turn a new page, sweep clean with a new broom, and take office on January 20th of next year with the ability to make a fresh assessment of exactly what our nation\\'s strategic position is as of the time the reigns of power are finally wrested from the group of incompetents that created this catastrophe.  Kerry should not tie his own hands by offering overly specific, detailed proposals concerning a situation that is rapidly changing and unfortunately, rapidly deteriorating, but should rather preserve his, and our country\\'s, options, to retrieve our national honor as soon as this long national nightmare is over.  Eisenhower did not propose a five-point plan for changing America\\'s approach to the Korean War when he was running for president in 1952.  When a business enterprise finds itself in deep trouble that is linked to the failed policies of the current CEO the board of directors and stockholders usually say to the failed CEO, \"Thank you very much, but we\\'re going to replace you now with a new CEO -- one less vested in a stubborn insistence on staying the course, even if that course is, in the words of General Zinni, \"Headed over Niagara Falls.\"  One of the strengths of democracy is the ability of the people to regularly demand changes in leadership and to fire a failing leader and hire a new one with the promise of hopeful change. That is the real solution to America\\'s quagmire in Iraq. But, I am keenly aware that we have seven months and twenty five days remaining in this president\\'s current term of office and that represents a time of dangerous vulnerability for our country because of the demonstrated incompetence and recklessness of the current administration.  It is therefore essential that even as we focus on the fateful choice, the voters must make this November that we simultaneously search for ways to sharply reduce the extraordinary danger that we face with the current leadership team in place. It is for that reason that I am calling today for Republicans as well as Democrats to join me in asking for the immediate resignations of those immediately below George Bush and Dick Cheney who are most responsible for creating the catastrophe that we are facing in Iraq.  We desperately need a national security team with at least minimal competence because the current team is making things worse with each passing day. They are endangering the lives of our soldiers, and sharply increasing the danger faced by American citizens everywhere in the world, including here at home. They are enraging hundreds of millions of people and embittering an entire generation of anti-Americans whose rage is already near the boiling point.  We simply cannot afford to further increase the risk to our country with more blunders by this team. Donald Rumsfeld, as the chief architect of the war plan, should resign today. His deputies Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and his intelligence chief Stephen Cambone should also resign. The nation is especially at risk every single day that Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.  Condoleeza Rice, who has badly mishandled the coordination of national security policy, should also resign immediately.  George Tenet should also resign. I want to offer a special word about George Tenet, because he is a personal friend and I know him to be a good and decent man. It is especially painful to call for his resignation, but I have regretfully concluded that it is extremely important that our country have new leadership at the CIA immediately.  As a nation, our greatest export has always been hope: hope that through the rule of law people can be free to pursue their dreams, that democracy can supplant repression and that justice, not power, will be the guiding force in society. Our moral authority in the world derived from the hope anchored in the rule of law. With this blatant failure of the rule of law from the very agents of our government, we face a great challenge in restoring our moral authority in the world and demonstrating our commitment to bringing a better life to our global neighbors.  During Ronald Reagan\\'s Presidency, Secretary of Labor Ray Donovan was accused of corruption, but eventually, after a lot of publicity, the indictment was thrown out by the Judge. Donovan asked the question, \"Where do I go to get my reputation back?\" President Bush has now placed the United States of America in the same situation. Where do we go to get our good name back?  The answer is, we go where we always go when a dramatic change is needed. We go to the ballot box, and we make it clear to the rest of the world that what\\'s been happening in America for the last four years, and what America has been doing in Iraq for the last two years, really is not who we are. We, as a people, at least the overwhelming majority of us, do not endorse the decision to dishonor the Geneva Convention and the Bill of Rights....  Make no mistake, the damage done at Abu Ghraib is not only to America\\'s reputation and America\\'s strategic interests, but also to America\\'s spirit. It is also crucial for our nation to recognize - and to recognize quickly - that the damage our nation has suffered in the world is far, far more serious than President Bush\\'s belated and tepid response would lead people to believe. Remember how shocked each of us, individually, was when we first saw those hideous images. The natural tendency was to first recoil from the images, and then to assume that they represented a strange and rare aberration that resulted from a few twisted minds or, as the Pentagon assured us, \"a few bad apples.\"  But as today\\'s shocking news reaffirms yet again, this was not rare. It was not an aberration. Today\\'s New York Times reports that an Army survey of prisoner deaths and mistreatment in Iraq and Afghanisatan \"show a widespread pattern of abuse involving more military units than previously known.\\'  Nor did these abuses spring from a few twisted minds at the lowest ranks of our military enlisted personnel. No, it came from twisted values and atrocious policies at the highest levels of our government. This was done in our name, by our leaders.  These horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that flowed directly from this administration\\'s contempt for the rule of law. And the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply unworthy of America - it is also an illusory goal in its own right.  Our world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable, and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.  A policy based on domination of the rest of the world not only creates enemies for the United States and creates recruits for Al Qaeda, it also undermines the international cooperation that is essential to defeating the efforts of terrorists who wish harm and intimidate Americans.  Unilateralism, as we have painfully seen in Iraq, is its own reward. Going it alone may satisfy a political instinct but it is dangerous to our military, even without their Commander in Chief taunting terrorists to \"bring it on.\"  Our troops are stretched thin and exhausted not only because Secretary Rumsfeld contemptuously dismissed the advice of military leaders on the size of the needed force - but also because President Bush\\'s contempt for traditional allies and international opinion left us without a real coalition to share the military and financial burden of the war and the occupation. Our future is dependent upon increasing cooperation and interdependence in a world tied ever more closely together by technologies of communications and travel. The emergence of a truly global civilization has been accompanied by the recognition of truly global challenges that require global responses that, as often as not, can only be led by the United States - and only if the United States restores and maintains its moral authority to lead.  Make no mistake, it is precisely our moral authority that is our greatest source of strength, and it is precisely our moral authority that has been recklessly put at risk by the cheap calculations and mean compromises of conscience wagered with history by this willful president.  Listen to the way Israel\\'s highest court dealt with a similar question when, in 1999, it was asked to balance due process rights against dire threats to the security of its people:  \"This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual\\'s liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day they (add to) its strength.\"  The last and best description of America\\'s meaning in the world is still the definitive formulation of Lincoln\\'s annual message to Congress on December 1, 1862:  \"The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise - with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history...the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation...We shall nobly save, or meanly lose the last best hope of earth...The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless.\"  It is now clear that their obscene abuses of the truth and their unforgivable abuse of the trust placed in them after 9/11 by the American people led directly to the abuses of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison and, we are now learning, in many other similar facilities constructed as part of Bush\\'s Gulag, in which, according to the Red Cross, 70 to 90 percent of the victims are totally innocent of any wrongdoing.  The same dark spirit of domination has led them to - for the first time in American history - imprison American citizens with no charges, no right to see a lawyer, no right to notify their family, no right to know of what they are accused, and no right to gain access to any court to present an appeal of any sort. The Bush Admistration has even acquired the power to compel librarians to tell them what any American is reading, and to compel them to keep silent about the request - or else the librarians themselves can also be imprisoned.  They have launched an unprecedented assault on civil liberties, on the right of the courts to review their actions, on the right of the Congress to have information to how they are spending the public\\'s money and the right of the news media to have information about the policies they are pursuing.  The same pattern characterizes virtually all of their policies. They resent any constraint as an insult to their will to dominate and exercise power. Their appetite for power is astonishing. It has led them to introduce a new level of viciousness in partisan politics. It is that viciousness that led them to attack as unpatriotic, Senator Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in combat during the Vietnam War.  The president episodically poses as a healer and \"uniter\". If he president really has any desire to play that role, then I call upon him to condemn Rush Limbaugh - perhaps his strongest political supporter - who said that the torture in Abu Ghraib was a \"brilliant maneuver\" and that the photos were \"good old American pornography,\" and that the actions portrayed were simply those of \"people having a good time and needing to blow off steam.\"  This new political viciousness by the President and his supporters is found not only on the campaign trail, but in the daily operations of our democracy. They have insisted that the leaders of their party in the Congress deny Democrats any meaningful role whatsoever in shaping legislation, debating the choices before us as a people, or even to attend the all-important conference committees that reconcile the differences between actions by the Senate and House of Representatives.  The same meanness of spirit shows up in domestic policies as well. Under the Patriot Act, Muslims, innocent of any crime, were picked up, often physically abused, and held incommunicado indefinitely. What happened in Abu Ghraib was difference not of kind, but of degree.  Differences of degree are important when the subject is torture. The apologists for what has happened do have points that should be heard and clearly understood. It is a fact that every culture and every politics sometimes expresses itself in cruelty. It is also undeniably true that other countries have and do torture more routinely, and far more brutally, than ours has. George Orwell once characterized life in Stalin\\'s Russia as \"a boot stamping on a human face forever.\" That was the ultimate culture of cruelty, so ingrained, so organic, so systematic that everyone in it lived in terror, even the terrorizers. And that was the nature and degree of state cruelty in Saddam Hussein\\'s Iraq.  We all know these things, and we need not reassure ourselves and should not congratulate ourselves that our society is less cruel than some others, although it is worth noting that there are many that are less cruel than ours. And this searing revelation at Abu Ghraib should lead us to examine more thoroughly the routine horrors in our domestic prison system.  But what we do now, in reaction to Abu Ghraib will determine a great deal about who we are at the beginning of the 21st century. It is important to note that just as the abuses of the prisoners flowed directly from the policies of the Bush White House, those policies flowed not only from the instincts of the president and his advisors, but found support in shifting attitudes on the part of some in our country in response to the outrage and fear generated by the attack of September 11th.  The president exploited and fanned those fears, but some otherwise sensible and levelheaded Americans fed them as well. I remember reading genteel-sounding essays asking publicly whether or not the prohibitions against torture were any longer relevant or desirable. The same grotesque misunderstanding of what is really involved was responsible for the tone in the memo from the president\\'s legal advisor, Alberto Gonzalez, who wrote on January 25, 2002, that 9/11 \"renders obsolete Geneva\\'s strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions.\"  We have seen the pictures. We have learned the news. We cannot unlearn it; it is part of us. The important question now is, what will we do now about torture. Stop it? Yes, of course. But that means demanding all of the facts, not covering them up, as some now charge the administration is now doing. One of the whistleblowers at Abu Ghraib, Sergeant Samuel Provance, told ABC News a few days ago that he was being intimidated and punished for telling the truth. \"There is definitely a coverup,\" Provance said. \"I feel like I am being punished for being honest.\"  The abhorrent acts in the prison were a direct consequence of the culture of impunity encouraged, authorized and instituted by Bush and Rumsfeld in their statements that the Geneva Conventions did not apply. The apparent war crimes that took place were the logical, inevitable outcome of policies and statements from the administration.  To me, as glaring as the evidence of this in the pictures themselves was the revelation that it was established practice for prisoners to be moved around during ICRC visits so that they would not be available for visits. That, no one can claim, was the act of individuals. That was policy set from above with the direct intention to violate US values it was to be upholding. It was the kind of policy we see - and criticize in places like China and Cuba.  Moreover, the administration has also set up the men and women of our own armed forces for payback the next time they are held as prisoners. And for that, this administration should pay a very high price. One of the most tragic consequences of these official crimes is that it will be very hard for any of us as Americans - at least for a very long time - to effectively stand up for human rights elsewhere and criticize other governments, when our policies have resulted in our soldiers behaving so monstrously. This administration has shamed America and deeply damaged the cause of freedom and human rights everywhere, thus undermining the core message of America to the world.  President Bush offered a brief and half-hearted apology to the Arab world - but he should apologize to the American people for abandoning the Geneva Conventions. He also owes an apology to the U.S. Army for cavalierly sending them into harm\\'s way while ignoring the best advice of their commanders. Perhaps most importantly of all, he should apologize to all those men and women throughout our world who have held the ideal of the United States of America as a shining goal, to inspire their hopeful efforts to bring about justice under a rule of law in their own lands. Of course, the problem with all these legitimate requests is that a sincere apology requires an admission of error, a willingness to accept responsibility and to hold people accountable. And President Bush is not only unwilling to acknowledge error. He has thus far been unwilling to hold anyone in his administration accountable for the worst strategic and military miscalculations and mistakes in the history of the United States of America.  He is willing only to apologize for the alleged erratic behavior of a few low-ranking enlisted people, who he is scapegoating for his policy fiasco.  In December of 2000, even though I strongly disagreed with the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to order a halt to the counting of legally cast ballots, I saw it as my duty to reaffirm my own strong belief that we are a nation of laws and not only accept the decision, but do what I could to prevent efforts to delegitimize George Bush as he took the oath of office as president.  I did not at that moment imagine that Bush would, in the presidency that ensued, demonstrate utter contempt for the rule of law and work at every turn to frustrate accountability...  So today, I want to speak on behalf of those Americans who feel that President Bush has betrayed our nation\\'s trust, those who are horrified at what has been done in our name, and all those who want the rest of the world to know that we Americans see the abuses that occurred in the prisons of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and secret locations as yet undisclosed as completely out of keeping with the character and basic nature of the American people and at odds with the principles on which America stands.  I believe we have a duty to hold President Bush accountable - and I believe we will. As Lincoln said at our time of greatest trial, \"We - even we here - hold the power, and bear the responsibility.\"',\n",

Anyhow, I would not have gone to that concert if it wasn\\'t for Julie K. who is my next door neighbour. She\\'s a really nice person. Her eldest son, Dan, is Fefe\\'s lead guitarist.   So we went downtown to Capital Music Hall. It was a tiny little place, well tiny compared to like the NAC lol. It was about the size of a gymnasium.   Okay so I was there, standing for like 10 minutes when the opening band (The Pettit Project) started. The lead singer dude, Scott Komer, is like 6\\'5\", blonde and really, really queery. There\\'s nothing wrong with queery people though. They played like all of their songs, about 8, I think. When they were done, I was happy that the night was almost through -- you see, I didn\\'t particularly LOVE them (at that time), I was more worried if I was ever going to hear again. The loudness of the music was well... extreme.  Next, Fefe came on and did all her schblewy -- that\\'s a brand new word I just came up with -- w00t!! She was pretty awsome. She had one song, which she said was new, \"Don\\'t Go, Boys and Girls\". It seemed to be about \"boys should be with boys, girls should be with girls, and boys should be with girls\", I think. I never really understood that one. I mean what does the title have to do with such a topic? \\xbfDon\\'t Go?  Afterwards, my mind sort of drifted -- like it does often -- and I started thinking about Pettit. I really wanted to get a CD. So I did. I made Scotty sign it. Yay! Anyway, they are all I can listen to now. I think I know all the words to the songs on that CD, as well as Mr. Obvious on http://purevolume.com/thepettitproject/music. These people absolutely rock my world.  What is so amazing about Pettit, is that I was never really in love with rock music. Now I am. I have pretty much begun ditching rap, except d12 and eminem!! I haven\\'t listened to much country or celtic or welsh or french or anything but Pettit, since I discovered them.  So we can now say that July 6th, 2004ce was a life changing day for moi.

       " \"As I begin my working life, I am starting to ponder about the real meaning of working. What is the main objective of working?   First of all, is it just a means to earning money? Should I try to get a job that is unbearable but gives me more money? I think I will hestitate to place money as the top criteria. Since I spend more time working than spending the money that I earn, the job should be at least satisfying. To me, people that work hard will spend hard. But is there a need to be this extreme? Why not work reasonably hard and not spend too much? And in the process, have some time out to engage in other more personal and fulfilling interests. Then again, why not make your job THE personal and fulfilling interest? That would be ideal, but I guess not many people can achieve that. The main reason is practicality (money earned may be less), and also figuring out what is really worth the time and effort.  Then comes the next question, is work more important than my personal life and leisure? Do I really want to forgo time that can spent enjoying life or having the company of friends, in my office? The company is not going to take care of you when you are sick, when you are retrenched. So why put in so much effort and time on something that doesn't really care? I wonder why so many people put so much effort in their work when they should be watching their children grow up, spending time with their spouses and old friends. Is it because they are just trying hard to make a living, and the jobs nowadays demand more of people? Or are they just really so interested in what they are doing?  I always feel that even the most interesting thing will get boring when you do it day in day out for many years. Does it mean that I will change job every few years? And lose the security that comes with job? Or will I adapt so well and become reluctant to switch job scope?\",\n",

       " \"I am thinking about the motivation to work, and it seems that the motivation has to come from somewhere that is outside of that person. I mean, he can be working to provide a good life for his family, gain recognition from his friends, earn money to satisfy material needs. Does anyone really work for the job itself, because the job is interesting and challenging? Or does anyone work to prove to himself that he is capable?  I don't think people really enjoy their work, or at least the majority of the people. But perhaps, they have grown used to doing it that somehow, they stick with it. In the end, it's the pay they get that's more important than the job itself.  For a guy with a girlfriend, I would think that in the initial years of his career, the motivation of working is to earn money so that enough can be saved for marriage. Marriage is not cheap here. Then after that, it would be working to earn money for raising children, which is also quite expensive. So for such a guy, the motivation to work is there.  However, for a guy without a girlfriend, the motivation is less clear. Will he be motivated to climb up the ladder so that girls would start to notice him more? By the time he reach there, he'll be over 30 I believe, and that age I think is a bit over the suitable marriage age. And if he spends all his effort on his work, he'll not have time to scout for a partner.\",\n",

(What the Ronneby bad boys seem to do for kicks is drive around in open top American cars playing alt.country, sort of loud.) Unfortunately, it's also very small. It kind of reminds me of Lytham, only with more trees.  The flight out was nice (after being frisked by security as my steel toe caps set the metal detectors off). The sights of the flight were clouded out (with the occasional contrails and sun devils), until we got close to the Danish coast, when the clouds parted to reveal a very, very long, very, very nice beach.  Memories of the Danish landscape included a field looking like a shattered glass window, flat, lots of farms fields, which all seemed to have a square area set aside in them (maybe it\\u2019s a law), quarries, islands, lakes and seas, boats and windmills.  Coming into land at Copenhagen Airport was quite fun, as the plane kept banking to lose altitude, which meant flying low over the sea (or was it a lake?), and I thought I kept seeing whales surfacing, but it was only waves.  After the three hour train trip, we arrived at the Ronneby Brunn Spa hotel - very nice, but reminds me of The Overlook Hotel from The Shining, lots of red carpets and long hallways.  Went for a walk on Tuesday afternoon to scope the place out, and ended up on a hill overlooking the hotel.   urlLink     urlLink     Anyway, the conference I'm here to attend is in full swing at the moment, so I've got to wrap this up before the afternoon workshops sessions start, which are all about tedious but necessary things such as interoperability and e-enabling your cat.  I've only managed to post this blog as the conference centre has broadband and free network connections lying around. No Internet in the Hotel, though there is porn per view. (90 Swedish krona a day. Cheap! Ya ya!)  More to come, if I can get another connection...\",\n",
       " 'You should realise that everywhere in London is a complete mystery to me and because of the diversity of the place it\\'s an adventure every time I head in to town.  But even so, it\\'s quite strange stepping out of a tube station in the middle of London, walking about 200 metres up the road, and suddenly feeling like you could be in some small town or village in the middle of Somerset (or somewhere equally not-London).  But that\\'s what I managed to do yesterday as I walked through Highgate.    The reason I was making my way (fairly quickly -- I was late) through that area of North London was because I was going to a preview show of Ade\\'s new play \"SUCCESS\" at the  urlLink Gatehouse  theatre -- a one man show written and starring the man himself.  I\\'ve never been to a small-scale production like that before (and considering there were only about 20 people there it was very small), but enjoyed thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Ade\\'s off up to Edinburgh next week for the Fringe festival and let\\'s hope for another award for him!    Another bonus of the night was that we sorted out who got which room in the house -- I got the middle room I was after!  Hooray!',\n",
       " \"For someone new to London (or just visiting as I have in the past) the London Underground is a saviour (despite being hot, crowded and late). Get a travelcard and you can just from one place to another without any problem at all.    But the problem with navigating London via the tube is that it gives a totally skewed impression of the Geography of the place. People get the tube when walking would have taken half the time, if only they knew where they were going. For example, in the past I've gone from Tottenham Court Road to Covent Garden by getting the Northern line to Leicester Square and then changing on to the Picadilly line. Now, that probably took about 25 minutes, but if I'd just walkd I could have done it in 15. Ish.         A couple of weeks ago I bought an A-Z which has put a few things into perspective, but for the most part I'm still stuck on tube-geography. Yesterday I came across a  urlLink handy little web page  which gives a number of tube maps, including a  urlLink geographically correct map of the underground .  Nice to see, but doesn't really give you an impression of how you can get from place to another.    But also included on that page is a PDF of the  urlLink geographical map superimprosed onto a street map ! It shows landmarks, train stations and railway lines, tube stop and lines, all in the correct locations, so now you really can see just how quick it would have been to walk instead of fighting the commute!\",\n",
       " 'Some people move to London for a job. Others, for a better life, or to be closer to friends and family. So what about me? Why did I decide up head into the big smoke? Well, to be honest, because I was bored. There\\'s only so much sitting around watching TV you can do without going a little stir crazy...     So how did it start? Well, for the last few months I\\'ve been unsettled and had been thinking about getting out on my own for a while, but with prices of everything soooo expensive around here, it wasn\\'t really an option. But then I got an email from Laura saying she was moving to London for a job and did anyone want to join her. My reaction? \"Why the hell not?\". A few weeks later, we met at Clapham Junction along with Ade, and within a few hours (yes, we were that lucky) we\\'d found somewhere perfect for all of us! All we have to do now if finish wrangling with the agent about the contract and move it! Woo hoo!     I\\'m kinda doing the commuting thing, but backwards -- I\\'m happy with my job and see no reason to change it, so every morning I\\'ll be getting the train out of London to Windsor and then repeating but in reverse in the evening. Doing that gives me a slightly quieter day day the chance to experience London in the evenings and weekends. I know plenty of people around and to be honest am looking forward to just being able to go to the pub for a quick drink, or head into the center and go to the Science Museum (where I\\'ve not been since I was about 12).     Until recently, I\\'d actually shunned the idea of moving to London as something that I would never do (I\\'m not a \"big places\" person) but for some reason I thought I\\'d give it a go. I\\'m young, free and not tied down, so why not experience something a bit different now while I\\'ve got the chance? And if I don\\'t like it, well, the contract\\'s only a year...',\n",
       " 'I managed to scrape up some money yesterday and purchased  Sleuth  from Larry (of Face2Face Games).  I think the artwork and quality of the game are super, although the linen of the cards are a bit too textured for my liking.  If you hold them a certain way, the light will glare off of the card and make it difficult to read the card.  This is such an improvement over the old 3M version of the game which had almost no artwork to speak of.  I think this is one of the things that I like best about Face2Face; they take the time and extra effort (read money) into making an already good game that much better.  I\\'m sure that  Sleuth  would have sold well if it was just a reprint of the 1967 3M game.  The attention to detail and improvement on presentation should make this a hit.  The family took the new version out for a \\'spin\\' this afternoon and had a pretty good time.  The game is a bit much for Julia (age 6) but she\\'s understanding some of the ideas.  She insists playing, though, so three-cheers for her tenacity!  I also finished reading Dean Koontz\\'s latest \"  The Taken  \".  I\\'ll give it a 3 out of 5 stars.  If it wasn\\'t for the ending, which tied the story up nicely, I\\'d have rated a one.  To me, this just didn\\'t stand up to the enjoyment, that I\\'ve come to expect, from a Dean Koontz book.  I\\'m usually struck by the characters in one of his yarns.  There\\'s always at least one character that I\\'m drawn to, and whom I\\'m interested in following.    The Taken   just doesn\\'t have the 3D characterization that I\\'m used to.  Granted the tale takes place for the most part over a time span of less than a day, and the action is roller-coaster paced.  So, what can I expect?  I guess I was just hoping for more.  Perhaps a longer novel would have sated my appetite.  I\\'m now on to read Stephen King\\'s   Dreamcatcher  .  Looks like alien conquest stories are filling some need.  :)',\n",
       " \"It's been quite a busy couple of days.  Work has had me zooming between Providence, RI and Newport three times so far.  Luckily the day is almost over so I'm kind of coasting into the weekend.  Had rehearsal over at the Mason's lodge on Wednesday and had a great time.  I really enjoy being with the guys and learning the protocols of opening and closing the lodge is very interesting.  I'm learning that my ability to do an 'about-face' is lacking.  Note to self... Don't wear rubber-soled shoes on meeting nights.  They have the propensity to grip the carpet when doing an about-face which I'm sure will eventually send me spilling to my keester in front of everyone.  Funny thing with all of this is that I was asked to be Senior Steward, instead of Junior Steward.  Honestly, I didn't really know what each office did, but I'm finding out that the Senior Steward, among other things, takes care of the kitchen and the meals for the lodge.  I'm kind of looking forward to do that, although I'm quite sure that it is going to take up a goodly chunk of time.  Lori, though, is quite supportive so it doesn't look like it is going to be any hardship.  I've also been spending my lunches with Larry at the Game Keeper.  It's usually always quite interesting visiting him and seeing the folks that wondering into the store.  Sid Sackson's  Sleuth  is now for sale.  I'd really like to get it, but we're a bit short on funds at the moment.  I'm going to call Lori to see if we can scrape up enough so we can get it for the weekend.  It would be fun to play while at the park with the kids.  I'm also hoping I can get a picnic setup in the next few weeks to have some friends over to the park and either play lawn type games or board games.  More later.\",\n",

First off, \"here\" at the moment is somewhere in the middle of the Arabian Gulf aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN-68).  We\\'ve been deployed since March 3, and we\\'re looking at staying out here until sometime between September and November.  Since we pulled out of San Diego, we\\'ve steamed halfway around the world, conducting flight operations, drills, and other training in preparation for going on-station in the Gulf.  We began supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom before we actually arrived in the Gulf, sending a pair of F-18 Super Hornets to the carrier Abraham Lincoln (which we later relieved).  Since that time, Nimitz has conducted flight operations over Iraq almost non-stop, supporting coalition ground troops and projecting an airborne presence in Iraqi airspace.  The Nimitz Strike Group has also conducted three successful portcalls in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and is looking forward to at least a few more before we depart for home.  Conditions in this area of the world are fairly harsh; temperatures shipwide average anywhere from 80-120 degrees, and our proximity to the desert makes airborne dust a constant source of headaches (particularly down in the propulsion plant, where I work; when we first got to the Gulf there were occasions where you could actually see clouds of dust blow through the plant as we passed through the remnants of a sandstorm).  We\\'ve managed to work our way past that problem, but only through constant hard work and vigilance.  We\\'ve had a few visits from notable figures in the past few months; the names include Conan O\\'Brien, General Tommy Franks (Commander, U.S. Central Command), Wayne Newton, Neil McCoy, the Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, Alyssa Milano, and R. Lee Ermey (Gunnery Sergeant Hartman in \"Full Metal Jacket\").  Some of us wanted Arnold Schwartzenegger to fly out here, but it looks like that probably ain\\'t happening.  Oh, well.

Like an epiphany but not quite as intense nor lucid. Peculiar how my dreams are always some abnormal event occuring. Anyway, for some reason, I dreamt I was married. Yes. I know I spoke about marriage before but hear me out first.  Anyway. Chris, I think I told you about this. Well.. Part of it anyway. I didn\\'t feel quite right about telling you the whole thing just yet, but heres the rest of it. My memory\\'s a little hazy, but as far as I can remember, I dreamt that I came home, wearing a suit no less and I was living in a dreamy South Yarra townhouse. Modern/contemporary architecture, futuristic design and all. Anyhow, I\\'m standing at my door in a suit, some expensive tailored one because I kept adjusting it and making it straight and all. Or maybe it was just my vanity, I\\'m not entirely sure. Guess who answers the door? That\\'s right. Miss You-Know-Who. No, not the one you guys are thinking of. Chris knows who I mean. I hate using names. And I suspect I might have given her the URL to this. I\\'m not sure. But I\\'m not taking any chances. Anyway, there\\'s the flurry of hugs and kisses as the lady literally pounces on me. Yes yes, then there\\'s the exchange of sweet-nothings and \"I miss you\" and \"I love you\" and yada yada yada. I\\'ll spare you the details.  Later on in the dream, I use the toilet and as I wash my hands, I see A FUCKING WEDDING RING. Just like the one I always had in mind, platinum with a small diamond inset. Don\\'t ask me how I know, I just do. Keep in mind however, that I was dreaming at the time and all this happening was perfectly normal to me and I did not once think that anything was out of place. Till I woke up.  Now, there\\'s a portion of the dream which I\\'m afraid I\\'m going to leave out due to sheer embarassment, but as I said. Chris, you already know the other bit. Dear Lord. Pardon me for dreaming of things like that, but you know I can\\'t help it. It was good though. Enjoyable... Mmmmmm...',\n",
       " u'It\\u2019s that time of the day again, the time where I lie in bed and try to induce a sort of sleep upon my body, except I know that it\\u2019s no use and I\\u2019ll just be spending the next hour or so lying in bed reflecting, having a myriad of different thoughts through my mind. Only difference with tonight would be that I brought my laptop to bed, with the intention of listening to music, but here I am writing this out.  For some reason however, that familiar yearning is back \\u2013 the one which was originally so devoid and empty. Maybe it\\u2019s the music I\\u2019m listening to, the familiar saxophone notes and piano harmonics, the sweet melody fills my mind and my thoughts then happen to befit the music.  Why not listen to hip-hop or something you ask. Nah, that stuff wakes me up and I need my rest. Although sleep is just a temporary reprieve from this existence I suffer from, a momentary escape from the malady.   I miss that. I think the feeling has always been there, except I never admitted it or neither would I have done so. Well, I am now, but oh well\\u2026 I think I miss knowing that there\\u2019s someone out there who tells you \\u201cI love you\\u201d and means it. Specifically, someone whom you love as well. Yada yada yada, I know I bitch and gripe about \\u201cWhat the fuck is love anyway?\\u201d. But give me this once, to whine about something else.  I don\\u2019t know what you [ie. The reader] looks for in a relationship. And truth be told, neither do I. I\\u2019d just be feigning wisdom and maturity if I pretended to know, although I do have a hunch of what I look for. However, it\\u2019s a theory, and no more than that.  In all my relationships, I always enjoyed the feeling that I had someone there for me. Someone whom upon meeting, there would be a flurry of hugs and kisses, but more than the physical motions, there would be an emotional connection. One in which we both knew we were special and one in which we were both completely happy with each other.  A friend of mine [who doesn\\u2019t have this URL but will still remain nameless] told me a few days [or was it yesterday\\u2026] that it was the worst feeling in the world to be with someone, and yet still feel lonely. How did that particular conversation come about you ask? To be frank, it was completely unexpected\\u2026 she asked how I was feeling, to which I replied \\u201cI\\u2019m cold. Miserable [domestic issues for the more curious of you]. Lonely [I\\u2019ve gone back to Kelly. My pillow] and not feeling well at all, thank you very much.\\u201d Here she was, a girl already with a boyfriend, who replied [after a few messages] that she still felt lonely around him.   Her answer surprised me, as this particular girl had been in a relationship with her boyfriend for a year and 2 months now. Or a year and 3 months, whichever, I don\\u2019t really pay attention. Anyhow, I wondered how you could last with someone for so long without feeling happy around them. For all the girls I\\u2019ve been with/gone out with/were a notch more than friends with, I\\u2019ve always felt happiest around a girl whom I\\u2019ve loved. Oh, and she loved me accordingly, reciprocating the affection. I couldn\\u2019t understand her answer, how her boyfriend and her could claim to love each other and wish to get married to each other [I\\u2019ve already talked about this. Read below] and how she could still feel lonely around him.   It still confounds me, to tell the truth, I don\\u2019t know why she told me that, or how to take it when she said that she only feels happy around yours truly. First off, she\\u2019s got her boyfriend, and I think it\\u2019s an evil thing to ruin a relationship. As such, I steered away from it, laughing it off as a joke, albeit a twisted one and the awkward silence which followed.   Girls. There\\u2019s just no understanding them.',\n",
       " 'Again, I start off with my disclaimer, the one that states I don\\'t intend to be arrogant and to blow my own horn, yada yada, that this is just a series of my thoughts, blah blah. You get the point.   Down to business. Someone I spoke to today mentioned that while I\\'m usually rather mature [hey, her misconception, not mine], on occasion, I am impossibly and unbelievably immature. Me being me, of course, asks for an elaboration of her point and she reported that it was the way I act and the things I talk about. Not so much the way I dealt with things, although my methods of dealing with somethings aren\\'t terribly mature, a fact which I\\'d readily admit to.  And now, lying in bed at 1.40 in the morning [thank God for wireless internet], I finally think about it and say \"Fuck maturity\". Fuck acting old and fuck being wise. If I\\'m a child, so be it. I\\'m quite happy to remain that way to tell the truth. As a child, I never had anything to really worry about, except maybe for how many toys I had. And even then, it was a minor issue, nothing which sure, I might\\'ve cried over [Man. Action Man toys meant the world to me back then], but nothing that left deep running scars.  Now however, with my sudden forceful thrust into a more mature world [well. More mature than Power Rangers and GI Joe\\'s, that\\'s for sure], I find myself wanting to revert back to my childhood days. Ignorance truly is bliss, if I don\\'t know it, it can\\'t hurt me! Oh sure, you suffer from the fact that you don\\'t know anything about the \\'real world\\', but the good bit of it is that you don\\'t even know that! Okay, that might sound confusing, lemme simplify it for you.  You don\\'t know that you don\\'t know anything. Which basically means, you don\\'t miss out on anything! How fantastic is that? Apart from the facts we face now, where we acknowledge that there\\'s a lot we don\\'t know and for all that we know, we already know too much. We aren\\'t afraid of physical wounds anymore, a bruise or stab wound is temporary, scars heal over and modern medicine works wonders for cover ups. Botox injections, boob jobs, skin grafts. We won\\'t have to worry about physical blemishes in the next 10yrs. However, the scars which really matter, those that make an impact would be the emotional ones. There\\'s no judge of how long it takes to heal and most of all, because it hurts at the worst times. Physical scars can be ignored, but emotional scars would always be at the back of your mind. Or mine at least.   And that sucks. Even then, my emotional scars wouldn\\'t be any worse than what the next teenager has to deal with. Nothing overtly dramatic has happened in my life, a fact which I\\'m grateful for, and I certainly don\\'t wish anything like that to happen. But then you stop to think \"If this guy, whom nothing major really happens to can be so fucking cynical about everything, how about a person whom deep shit has happened to?\"  Certainly makes you think twice about saying something to a person whose parents died in a car accident when they were 2yrs old doesn\\'t it? Same with a person who faces a medical problem and is that way because they were born like that. So do the world a favour, think before you speak or do anything. I know I don\\'t really do that, but hey, I\\'m trying. Give me that.  Funny thing is, it\\'s all part of growing up. This whole \"How to be a person\" bullshit. Peter Pan! Come take me away! Fly me to Neverland! I promise not to join Captain Hook!',\n",
       " u'Being sentient creatures, humans in general worry about the future. Generally, we think about a particular facet of our lives, chiefly our career direction, spouse and the like. Most people think about 5 or 10 years ahead, anything beyond that being too far away to worry about, although we do contemplate the future in moments of boredom. Or at least, I do anyway. Yet I wonder though, for all the dreams and ambitions we have, how many would come true?  Even now, I look at some of the relationships my friends hold [No. this isn\\u2019t directed at anyone in particular, so don\\u2019t bug me about it.] and I notice a particular trend going around that after about 3 or 4 months, both parties in the particular relationship would say that they would like to marry each other. I have relatively little doubt that its an insincere statement. For those who say it, I\\u2019m sure they really do desire a marriage or at least, a long term relationship with the other person. What I doubt however, is the likelihood of it happening.   Every single relationship I\\u2019ve had [specifically. The serious ones where I actually felt something for her, whoever she is], I\\u2019ve been prepared to marry the girl involved. I think there would only be two of such relationships, where I actually desired a long term thing with them and not some 1 or 2 week thing which happens. Well the want for them was there, I admit that it was an unrealistic dream. Not that I would\\u2019ve admitted it at the time, but gifted with hindsight now, I grudgingly concede. I\\u2019m about 16yrs old now and all of you are older than I am, although not significantly [ie. More than 5yrs] and everything I say from here is an assumption. Believe you me, I\\u2019m quite happy for those attached among you to stay with your current squeeze, marry him/her and then go have your kids somewhere. Whichever.   What I ask though is the likelihood at which that would happen. This would probably be directed towards the most sentimental amongst you, those who talk about marriage as if it were a week away and it is inevitable. Those of you who claim to be deeply in love with each other [hey. I admit I still don\\u2019t know what love is, although I think I\\u2019ve got a general idea of the outline] and who forget that marriage is probably about a good 10 years away for all of us.  Pardon my cynicism, but I can\\u2019t help but wonder what would happen in not something as long as the next 10 years, but only the next 2 years\\u2026 or one, for that matter. Human life is fragile, anything could happen at anytime. Fate could deal a bad card and one side of your relationship would suffer a fatal and tragic accident. Boohoo. Or maybe it won\\u2019t be as dramatic as that and \\u201cshit happens\\u201d and the relationship falls apart.   I could come up with any number of scenarios illustrating my point, but basically the message is the same. I, personally [and again, this is my opinion and I might be wrong] think that relationships that occur at this age won\\u2019t last. And even for those that do, how long would they last for? I\\u2019ve never seen or heard of a relationship [and this might be due to sheer ignorance] that lasted from the age of 18 onwards till adulthood and into marriage. Oh sure, you get tabloid reports of childhood sweethearts meeting after 20years and reigniting a spark. But how many actually last the 10 year wait till marriage?   Then again, I do concede that it\\u2019d be kinda cute if someone really did get married after 10 years in a relationship together. But I think romantic stories like those have been lost in literature, never coming out and manifesting itself in the real world. Go ahead somebody. Prove me wrong. Stay with him/her till a suitable marriageable age [ie. When both of you have careers and all] and get married. And stay married.   I understand the obvious difficulty in agreeing with what I have just said [if you do] and then actually saying it out. I imagine in a moment of amorousness, it would spoil the roses to say \\u201cNah. I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll get married. It\\u2019s too far away to think\\u201d. Of course, it\\u2019d be much simpler [and less tear filled too, might I add] to say \\u201cYeah. And we\\u2019ll have kids and name them X and Y\\u201d. Even if both parties do know that it\\u2019s the reality of things, they usually are intelligent enough to know that it\\u2019d cause a moment of awkwardness and silence, the type caused by mentioning taboo subjects like a possible break up. And as we all know\\u2026 Simplicity is often the way to go with things.   Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I\\u2019m not asking you all to go out and tell your significant other how I feel about this. It\\u2019s my opinion, and I guess for all the women I\\u2019ve cared about, I\\u2019ve had bad experiences with.   Which brings me to bitch. Why is it only the women I care for whom I have had bad experiences with\\u2026 I think I\\u2019ll leave this one for another day.',\n",

       " u'Metaphysics is a rather obscure branch of philosophy which examines the nature of reality and the relationship between mind and matter. Most people, unfortunately, take for granted that reality exists; that some kind of perfect (again I slip in a note that it is subjective) world lies beyond the realm of imperfect manner [ie. Our realm]. In a religious manner of speaking, this perfect world is termed Heaven some other word describing the domain of the spirit. In Western philosophy, metaphysical reality is patterned after Plato\\u2019s world of perfect forms from which our senses draw a distorted image of the true reality.  If this realm exists, how do we know it\\u2019s there? It is a hypothetical construct, inaccessible to our senses but we believe, foolishly or otherwise, that it is there. Christians look at the Bible as a book of law; a constant in this malevolent world of ours where everything is unpredictable and often, the most unexpected happens unless we are fortunate enough to be gifted with foresight. As such, Christians believe the existence of a realm like Heaven simply because \\u201cthe Bible said so\\u201d and because they have been led to believe of its existence. This is not to say that I\\u2019m an atheist, although what I\\u2019m saying might be considered to be in support of atheism, maybe even sacrilegious. Deep down, I am a Christian, albeit not a very strong one and whilst my faith is still shaky and I\\u2019m far from being a crucifix wearing zealot, I still have some faith in the Lord.    However, I still struggle with my faith. To believe or not to believe; I can\\u2019t answer that question seeing as I really don\\u2019t know. On some occasions of my life, I appear to have been let down by Christ. Where some people might say that \\u201cIt\\u2019s all part of the plan\\u201d, I believe in direct methods of dealing with things. However, on some events in my life, I wonder if they occurred because of chance or because a higher power had caused events to occur that way.  Just some food for thought.',\n",
       " 'Some people asked me why I had decided to put \"Free Jono\" on the back of my Year 12 jumper. Well, first off, it\\'s an ambiguous phrase which has meaning both during my lockdown period and after.  If you choose to look at the word \"Free\" as a verb [ie. an action word], then it\\'s a plea for freedom. A message on the back of the jumper which means by wearing the jumper, I\\'m asking for my freedom back. For liberation and final emancipation from my jail wardens. Awhile back, I likened myself to being locked in a penintentiary where I had my jail wardens and so on and so forth. By wearing the jumper, it\\'s like a protest against them and whilst a worthless and useless method of peaceful protest, a method nonetheless.  However, should you chose to look at the word \"Free\" as an adjective [ie. a describing word], a whole different meaning takes place. That second meaning will come into effect only after my Year 12 exams are well and truly over and the moment they say \"You are dismissed\" at about 10.45 in the morning on the 10th of November 2004... I\\'ll be free.   Hence my reason for choosing that as a logo on the back of my jumper. To remind myself, even in my old age [if I decide to keep the damn thing] about my situation in Year 12.',\n",
       " 'For those of you on Friendster, and most of you are, you see that whenever I complete a questionaire where they ask \"Are you in love\" or \"Ever been in love\", I always reply with a question of my own or claim that I don\\'t know the meaning of love and what it entails. If I cannot even begin to define it, how can I claim to be in it?  Anyhow, this morning, after reading a quiz written by a friend, I came up with a few statements and questions to help us figure out what this whole Love thing is about.    Love is not about what you are prepared to do for the other person   People are limited by physical and financial means and some other person might be able to carry out a task with relative ease what another person might find an impossible task.  [ie. An olympic runner would be able to run 100km with ease whereas a paraplegic might find it exceedingly difficult. No wait. Impossible. Same as a billionaire would be able to buy a villa whereas a street bum might not even be able to guarantee a meal.]  But that doesn\\'t mean the other one who can\\'t provide the same amount or more loves her  [and I use \"her\" because I\\'m a male. So I talk about things from the male side of the show. Sue me all ye feminists].  While a person probably  would  do more for a person he loves, this is not necessarily the case and a definition has to be universal and this rule would not apply to everyone.   Love rather, is about what you\\'d be prepared to give up   Now Jana, this was the purpose of my question. I hypothesized awhile ago that to love a person would mean wanting them to be happy even at your own expense and this one explains it. Not only the materialistic physical or financial means as aforementioned. I think the most important sacrifices are made in intangible means. Money can be re-earned and energy regained, heck, even physical scars can be \\'fixed\\' by means of modern day surgery  [they can even make you look like me now. God forbid, naturally. But the option is there should you choose to want a permanent Halloween mask] . However, emotional scars never ever go away. Whilst they aren\\'t visible, we know they\\'re there and they continue to hurt more intensely and for longer than physical ones do.   Love is about acceptance   If Ken told me he loved Jane  [fictitious names. I don\\'t know anyone by those names and thank God for that]  but that he rather she\\'d be smarter or that she\\'d be prettier, I\\'d question  [maybe not to his face, but certainly at the back of my mind]  if he really loved her or not. I think that to love someone means accepting them for who they are, and whilst I\\'m not so bold as to claim that it means that you don\\'t love them, I\\'d wonder if you really do love them as much as you say you do if you can\\'t accept them for them. I would think however, that you\\'re in love with who you want them to be and not them. Confusing, I\\'ll grant you, but stop to think about it and just maybe you\\'ll get the gist of what I\\'m trying to say. Pardon my ineloquence.  That\\'s a slight idea of what goes on in my head sometimes. I\\'ve got more on the way but I can\\'t really be fucked typing them all out and don\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not THAT arrogant to say that I have now defined Love and given a universal definition to it. It\\'s just some rules that I\\'ve come up with and like always, I might be wrong. And rules were meant to be broken anyway.',\n",
       " 'Last night, I was lying in bed, and as all normal people do, I found myself quickly slipping into a state of drowsiness and then into sleep. From sleep, I passed through the dreamless state and entered Dreamland. The place where we enjoy ourselves and relive our deepest desires, survive our worst nightmares and well, to cut a MELODRAMATIC story short, it\\'s a place where what happens there, generally stays there and we don\\'t give it much thought in our waking hours.  Anyhow, last night, I had a dream which I felt was... weird [My kingdom for a more eloquent word!]. More interestingly, it was centered around a particular person. She-who-shall-not-be-named. God I feel stupid using that. Damn you J.K. Rowling. For the purpose of displaying the abnormality of the dream, I had another one just last week centered around the same general idea. I\\'ll explain in order of sequence [or what I think is the sequence in which they occured].   Last night, the dream was of me. Standing alone in a dimly lit carpark where I was by myself. Wearing funky clothes too mind you. All of a sudden, she walks up to me and for no rhyme or reason I said \"Kiss me\" [When I woke, I thought about the stupidity of the statement and just wondered why I said, of all things, that. Not even a greeting or a pleasantry. A simple two words]. Here\\'s the clincher. She did. Oh, sure it happened in a dream, but I\\'m surprised that my mind, despite my wild imagination and twisted thought processes, could come up with that. I was [in my dream] understandably confused as to why she did and proceeded to ask her about her boyfriend.  \"He never loved me, he just used me [Nb. Here I cringed in my dream and felt a stab through my heart. Emotional knife 101] and I don\\'t know why I ever loved him... I should never have taken you for granted and I\\'m so sorry about that, would you ever forgive me?\"  Well. Um. Here, I say \"I don\\'t know... I\\'ve got a lot of questions I need answering. Like why did we -break- in the first place.\"  \"You never show how much you cared [Nb. b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. I think, in the real world, I displayed how much I cared for her enough. I think. But that led me, upon waking, to realise the dream was complete and utter horseshit.] and we could never see each other... I didn\\'t want to be ditched for someone else; you know me... I don\\'t like being ditched and I thought I had to ditch you first.\"  \"Fine. But you do know that I would\\'ve waited for you forever and ever if it came down to it... And you just had to tell me how you felt. That\\'s all you had to do hun [eh wtf.]...\"  And then more hugging and reconcilation and we kiss again.  So that was the dream last night.  The dream the previous week, was one where you [this is to Chris and Jana], her and I were on a double date. We were walking along Collins Street, in the city, and it was just like old times. More laughing and smiling. And everyone was happy; nothing in the world was wrong and it couldn\\'t have been more perfect. Chris and Jana were in the front, walking and holding hands with each other [as they always fucking do] and here and I were up the back whispering sweet-nothings to each other, her head resting on my shoulder.   Now, I don\\'t know about what you think. But here and now, I solemnly swear that I have no more emotions [at least not in that way] for the girl. Sure, I think about her at night [but hey, I even think about randoms] but I don\\'t think it\\'d be anything abnormal. Honestly, tell me you\\'ve never thought about relationships long past at night whilst lying in bed and just reminscing.   And on both occasions, I woke up, scratching my head and thinking I have the most fucked up mind anyone is in possession of. Of all the people to dream about, I dreamt about... her.',\n",

This mist comes in gradually, slowly thickening in texture till as afore mentioned, visibility is at zero.  Then the mist clears.  And it reveals the walls, no longer are you in your elaborately designed and comfortable room but you're sitting in a cube. The walls, looking like they are made of a plate of metal and discoloured slightly, are far enough for you to move around but close enough that you begin to feel nauseas and slightly claustrophobic. A familiar knot, associated with fear, starts to twist in your stomach and you wonder where this is all leading.  But you already know.  The walls start to move in on you, the room starts to lose its dimensions and for a split second, you wonder how it is possible for the walls to shrink in from all directions at the same time. You both marvel at the ingenuity of the rooms creator and how its intelligence will lead to your ultimate death.  But centimetres away from reducing you into a paper-thin wafer of yourself, the walls stop moving.

Your jaw does not have enough space to move. You panic and your mind starts to race as it both looks for a way out and resigns itself to its fate. You feel queasy as your sympathetic nervous system causes your body to rise to a fight-flight response, releasing all manners of enzymes in your body and causing your muscles to become stronger but due to their inability to move, the lactic acid buildup gives you cramps. You become desperate and not only does your mind works to try to escape, it also runs through scenarios in your life. The worst memories and the best ones. And you wonder if you will ever see the light of day again.  Throughout it all. You cannot. Move.  And then someone tells you to smile. How do you feel? Like I do?\",\n",
       " u'This is how bored and sad I am. 1.30 in the morning on a Friday night and instead of being out or doing my thing, I\\u2019m home watching Kill Bill Vol. 2. Again. This time, I watched the whole film and interestingly enough, I discovered a few interesting things while watching the credits.  Michael Parks plays both Sheriff McGraw in one of the initial scenes in Volume 1 and Senor Esteban in Volume 2. I mean, I don\\u2019t know about you, but he wouldn\\u2019t be considered a famous actor but he\\u2019s pretty good, managing to pull off a redneck Texas accent flawlessly as McGraw and then goes on to play a perfect Mexican pimp. Exactly as you\\u2019d expect it from the stereotypes you get. Interesting what make up could do and cover up I guess.   Gordon Liu plays both Johnny Mo, the head of the Crazy 88 in Volume 1, and then again as Pai Mei, the kick ass kung fu God in Volume 2. From a distinct lack of hair to an excess of it.   Even lesser known would be Samuel L. Jackson, who from having a major part in Pulp Fiction, goes to being Rufus, the piano player in Volume 2. Still, he and Uma Thurman would probably be the only big names in the movie itself, including both volumes, except for maybe Chiaki Kuriyama, the plastic-faced Japanese actor who plays Gogo Yubari, the psychotic school girl. But she\\u2019s only big in Japan. I think.   Pretty sad how I watch so much horseshit nowadays. Not that it\\u2019s a bad movie, just that\\u2026 it\\u2019s an excess of it. Same with TV; every night, without fail, I\\u2019d watch The Simpsons [Channel 10, 6-6.30pm]. It\\u2019s like a damned ritual for me, one which I carry out daily. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve missed an episode yet, except for Mondays, where I\\u2019ve got English tutoring.    I need a life.',\n",
       " u'I had the distinct pleasure of watching 4 movies the other night; courtesy of a school friend who was nice enough to burn them onto CD for me. Anyway, I figured I\\u2019d share my mind on them, like it or not.    Kill Bill Vol. 2  God this is a cool movie. Much like any other Tarantino film, the movie is broken up into chapters and then twisted into one incredible film. We see the past of The Bride [a.k.a. Beatrix Kiddo for those chumps out there who didn\\u2019t know] and obviously, how she deals with the remaining nemesis\\u2019s out there.   Still, although lacking the  quantity  of bloodshed of the first, it makes up for it with the  quality  of death in the second. Bud gets a snake bite in the face, Elle Driver gets her eye ripped out and Bill, as could be foreseen, gets hit by the Five Point Palm exploding technique. Some tricky shit that Pai Mei taught Beatrix. It\\u2019s a bit of an anti-climax, but I guess it\\u2019d be pointless having them cross Hanzo swords before someone gets a limb sliced off.    A person like Pai Mei who from information leaked in the movie, could possibly be immortal, is considered a pugilist with an unholy proficiency in martial arts and has wisdom far greater than any other being on this Earth. This man is killed by a hot headed Caucasian female under his tutelage. Not only that, he is killed by underhanded means and not an outright battle. That much I can understand. What gets me thinking though, is that if I were Pai Mei, and I\\u2019m neither as smart nor as powerful, I\\u2019d sure as hell make sure I have the ability to purge poison from my body. If I could kill a person by merely tapping him on his body with my fingertips, wouldn\\u2019t I have some all-neutralizing antidote? But okay, I guess for the sake of the movie, we\\u2019ll let that little worm of a treacherous bitch kill the coolest character in the movie.    Pulp Fiction  Watching these two in a row, I got a taste of Tarantino overload. Still, it\\u2019s good to watch the man at work, he sure makes a mean movie. Coupled with a A-list team of celebrities and we have ourselves a blockbuster. Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman [I wonder. Does Tarantino have something for her\\u2026 She\\u2019s pretty fine looking in Kill Bill, but not so much here], John Travolta [check out the ponytail] and Samuel L. Jackson.  However, at some parts of the movie, I feel I must question Tarantino\\u2019s\\u2026 taste. Oh sure, it\\u2019s a subjective thing and all but is it  really  necessary to see a big, black, bald man getting anal raped by another man? For god\\u2019s sake. After watching that, I damn well nearly had to get my eyes cleaned out with paint thinner.    Pirates of the Caribbean  Ah. This particular one had girls all over swooning over the two main characters. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. Speaking as a male and I concede that I might be mistaken, I think Orlando Bloom looked better in LOTR. Johnny Depp definitely steals the limelight from Orlando Bloom as the incredibly charismatic and sneaky pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow.   No complaints with this movie though, nothing I could particularly nitpick on. Oh wait. There is. Jack Sparrow occasionally acts like a pansy. Getting slapped by a woman is a painful ordeal [although I\\u2019ve never known truth be told. I cover my tracks well] but I doubt a swashbuckling corsair who lays the smack down on a cursed crew of pirates would run and walk like he puts foundation on at home.    Donnie Darko  Now this one\\u2026 First though at the start of the movie: \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d. Last thought at the end of the movie: \\u201cWhat the fuck?\\u201d The movie doesn\\u2019t help clarify anything and I have no inkling of how the movie managed to make it into the top 100 [imdb.com].   Definitely lots to pick on this one. I don\\u2019t know about you, but if I were to travel through time, I wouldn\\u2019t pick a gigantic demonic bunny suit to travel with. I\\u2019d pick something like\\u2026 Luke Skywalker\\u2019s robes or a Darth Maul costume instead of a satanic looking soft toy. Even then.   I didn\\u2019t get this one, but you could blame it on my stupidity instead of the movie\\u2019s fault I guess. I\\u2019ll make it a point to rewatch this one. After doing something less painful. Like sticking my dick into an oven on high heat.',\n",
       " u'People keep asking me what I want to do in university. The answer to this is really quite clich\\xe9d, seeing as I\\u2019d like to do Law, however unrealistic, in university. It\\u2019s especially important with my parents, both of the typical Asian breed and believing completely in paper qualifications and that your education is of vital importance such that one without lives a condemned life. This sure as hell isn\\u2019t true, seeing as more than a few people have made it in a big way in life without even having completed high school. So much for your PhD dad.  Maybe I should elaborate; with my life, no matter how boring and monotonous, I\\u2019d like to do something with it. I figure that everyone\\u2019s got a talent somewhere, no matter what in. Of course, there are those with talents in nothing useful, but I suppose some would regard it a talent nonetheless. I personally don\\u2019t know what talents I possess. I\\u2019m still trying to figure that one out. Or at least, the good characteristics so I know which ones to hone on in. I\\u2019ll tell you what though? I\\u2019m particularly good at the art of horseshit. Which really, is a pathetic thing to be talented in, although it might come in handy getting yourself out of trouble.  Since I was young, I\\u2019ve always entertained the idea of having my own store. I never quite figured out what I wanted to do with the store but at different parts of my life, various ideas came to mind. Oh sure, there\\u2019s been the caf\\xe9 phase, the toy store, even the LAN gaming centre. Nothing that particularly sticks out I guess, except for maybe the florist. But that\\u2019s another tale for another day.   However, with all those hare brained ideas, I never ever filled a niche. I would be one of many and knowing myself rather well, I know I would be unhappy at the prospect of not being a little, beautiful and unique snowflake. Man I\\u2019m sarcastic.   Anyhow, it was a few weeks ago when I stumbled upon the beginnings of an idea which I\\u2019ve given some thought to. See, I love clothes shopping but a major problem with that is that you\\u2019ve got to walk around and spend your money at different places; which is fine, unless you happen to own the store and quite naturally, you\\u2019d like everyone to spend their money at yours. But what would set apart my store from the rest?  First and foremost, it would be a basic store selling street clothes. By that, I mean the clothes that I wear. Kinda like\\u2026 my style, but me selling it instead of buying. For the less informed among you, this would mean brands like XLARGE, Stussy, Zoo York, Freshjive, etc etc. Ah, but there are plenty of stores like that, Mooks for example, retails all that and what would set me apart from that? Apart from the fact that I\\u2019d like my store to stock shoes as well, excessive amounts, mind you, like half Hype DC and the other half Mooks. Not only that, music CD\\u2019s would be on sale, along with headphones, turntables and other instruments that a budding musician would need.   But what would be the audience I cater to? I figure, right about now, with this particular idea, I\\u2019m targeting youths aged 16 \\u2013 late 20\\u2019s. Or those particularly young at heart at any rate. However, the catered group would be a stratified one. They would be the clubbers and not the pub-bers, if you get that. You\\u2019re definitely not going to be able to get Shania Twain whereas you\\u2019d be able to find more underground hip-hop stuff. Like all the DJ Shadow records. On 12\\u201d.  Fundamentally, the store would cater to me. Or that\\u2019s the bottom line anyway. Pretty fucking small target group ey? But this is a youth superstore. It sells most things a youth would need seeing as we can\\u2019t really spend our money at much else anyway [besides alcohol and tobacco], so we spend it on clothes, drugs, alcohol, CD\\u2019s, a car and other wasteful instruments of entertainment. The store would stock most things our mischievous generation would want without crossing the legal lines.  But here\\u2019s where I fill the niche. Many a time, I\\u2019ve gone to a shop and requested for a specific T-shirt. I\\u2019m the type of person who knows what I want before I go into the store and I\\u2019ve got a rather one-tracked mind. See, I\\u2019m not going to say that my store would have literally, everything. I understand and sympathize that my stocks are not complete and I will lack in some things. Here\\u2019s where I differ from other stores.   While another retail store might say \\u201cHey look, we don\\u2019t stock it, sorry, we\\u2019ll be getting fresh stock in a month\\u2019s time, come back then\\u201d and leave you thinking \\u201cThanks a lot. Thanks for nothing.\\u201d I would, tell you \\u201cSorry, but we don\\u2019t stock it right now, if you\\u2019d like I could order it for you. That particular T-shirt.\\u201d How good would that be? Imagine wanting say, Air Force One\\u2019s (Ltd. Edt. Year of the Monkey\\u2019s), and going to a store which doesn\\u2019t have it. Which is fine. But imagine if they could get it for you if you\\u2019d wait for about two weeks or so. Same with the music CD\\u2019s [but they\\u2019ve got to be good. Don\\u2019t come in requesting fucking Backstreet Boys unless you want a Louisville slugger on the side of your head].   Not only that, the employees would be a tad different to other places. See, I don\\u2019t pride myself on being good-looking, I admit, I couldn\\u2019t begin to compare to say Orlando Bloom or whoever the fuck you pick. But herein lie the perks of being the boss. I get to pick the employees. Call me discriminatory, but I\\u2019d like to hire employees who carry the clothes well. For example, going into Mooks today, I saw what a yuppie would term a metrosexual. In other words, a pussy boy. See, no fucking way would I hire something like that. Girls are meant to be beautiful, tall, lithe and sexy creatures that put lipstick on. Males, at their epitome of physical perfection are not meant to carry make-up kits around and wear G-strings. I\\u2019m sorry. Sue me.   It\\u2019s still an idea. I think it could work, but the basic problem would be getting it off the ground. I\\u2019ll need a bit of capital for doing that and I know my parents sure as hell aren\\u2019t going to give it to me. Maybe one day\\u2026 Oh of course, the delusions of grandeur are present and I fantasize about going global seeing as I don\\u2019t think anyone\\u2019s really done this before. Or at least not that I know of, which could be due to sheer ignorance.   And then there\\u2019s the idea about the club. That one\\u2026 I\\u2019d like to do. But probably after the store. We\\u2019ll see.',\n",
       " u'All of us look for different things when we search for a potential member of the opposite sex. Some of us dig materialistic things, wanting tangible output out of the relationship. These include those girls and boys who date the rich kids, hoping to get a new Louis Vuitton bag out of it, or just excessive pampering. Others look for that someone special to be with, and these are the ones known as the sincere, loving ones. But for whatever the reason, we all look for specific things in the opposite sex.   Honestly, I acknowledge that looks do matter and that physical attraction is always a strong starter for a relationship. It\\u2019s what sparks your interest in the potential significant other in the first place. I\\u2019m tempted to say that I put looks over all else, but someone here would fuck me up for that, so I\\u2019m not going to. All I\\u2019ll say however is that taste is subjective. So there.   Still, don\\u2019t you ever realise that\\u2026 for some incomprehensible reason, the person you feel for is always the most beautiful person on earth? I can\\u2019t even begin to understand it, and I sure as hell can\\u2019t explain it, but I think that all of you know what I\\u2019m talking about. Sometimes, a person appears only moderately attractive or perhaps even slightly unattractive to you. But after you start to fall in love\\u2026 your perception changes. All of a sudden, she\\u2019s the most gorgeous woman that ever existed. You could actually say those words without lying, honestly meaning it with every fibre of your being and genuinely adoring her. Against overwhelming odds, you might beg to differ when someone calls her average looking or perhaps, God forbid, ugly. You would argue for her, trying in futility to convince everyone that even Aphrodite herself could not hold a candle to your beloved.  Personally, the thing which has always attracted me to a woman would be her eyes and smile. Clich\\xe9d but true nonetheless. I\\u2019ve never understood why someone\\u2019s eyes could move so little, but yet tell you so much. I personally reckon it\\u2019s all in the eyes. Oh sure, the face plays a big part in it, but her eyes would certainly be the major focus of it all. Lying in bed with your sweetheart, looking her in the eye, for some reason, you just know how she feels. It\\u2019s at that time where I start to feel fuzzy and warm all over, where heart-shaped fireworks explode in my heart and truly, eternity would not be enough time for me to tell her how much I love her. Her eyes might come in any number of shapes, for Asians, they\\u2019re typically long narrow slits, with perhaps a slight hump in the middle, tinged with brown, but Oriental nonetheless. Your archetypal Anglo-Saxon female would have blue eyes and long girly lashes whereas a female of Negroid descent might have circular eyes, short eyelashes with a touch of ruggedness behind them.   If her eyes were to be rubies inset into a face of platinum, her lips would definitely be parallel rows of diamond. These are, to me at any rate, the star attraction of any female\\u2019s countenance. If she were to be upset or depressed, successfully performing the feat of rescuing her unhappy soul from the abyss of dejection would fill me with more joy than this page could hold. A girl\\u2019s smile, for whatever reason, is always a beautiful thing. Even if she were to be considered not-as-attractive-to-others, a smile on her would cause a glow to radiate from her similar to the manner in which the Sun spreads its warmth on this wretched planet of ours. Imagine then, if your precious smiled at you. How beautiful would she look?   God. I\\u2019m going mushy in my insanity. Still, I\\u2019m entitled to dream in my singlehood no?',\n",
       " u'Living in Melbourne\\u2019s a great thing. It\\u2019s a nice city, livable and where the weather ain\\u2019t half bad all year round. I could go on and on about why I love this city but I think you get the general idea. Most importantly, some of the women here are pretty damn hot. Going to clubs, or Asian clubs anyway, you observe a stratified sample of the population of Asian women around. Don\\u2019t get me wrong, not every single one of them are beautiful [although one can wish\\u2026] but in general, they\\u2019re generally in possession of a pretty face, or at least a curvaceous body.   One thing confuses me though. Why is it you never get hot neighbours? I don\\u2019t know about you, but I\\u2019ve never ever lived anywhere close [and by this I mean on the same street] as a beautiful female around my age. Oh sure there\\u2019ve been instances when I was younger [like the time I was living next to Fann Wong, the girl in Shanghai Knights]. But hey, I was 11 and she was in her mid 20\\u2019s. Good luck with that.  Anyhow, over the last 2 years, for all the houses I lived in, I\\u2019ve never had the fortune to reside next to a hot blooded female who looked semi decent. The female who best suits my\\u2026 criteria living close to me drives a P-plated car, which lets me think she\\u2019s within the age range of 18-21. But she\\u2019s so\\u2026 unattractive that the mere sight of her ruins any chance I have of getting a boner over the next 50 years.   So, in a moment of sheer boredom and curiosity, this afternoon I did some calculations on my own. You sure didn\\u2019t think probability would come in handy eh? I figured it a little something like this. Melbourne has a population of around 4.3 million people and half of them would be females right? As we all know, the probability of a girl being at least moderately good looking on a scale of 10 would mean that she is at least a 5. Statistically, it\\u2019s about Pr(Looks\\u2265 5) = 9/30. [You\\u2019ll never believe where I got it from] Which gives a nice number of 0.3.   If you ask me, that\\u2019s a pretty good probability rate. But that\\u2019s a stratified sample and if only a third of all girls were at least decent looking. If only. But for simplicity\\u2019s sake, I\\u2019m more than willing to use it.   But the buck doesn\\u2019t stop there. There has to be a predefined range of ages right? Seeing as I\\u2019m 16, and I\\u2019ve never been with a younger girl, I\\u2019m going to make an exception here. I\\u2019m taking all females aged 14-20. Shut up. Not a word. I know 14\\u2019s young. And that 20\\u2019s old. But I\\u2019m being generous here. Again, statistically, this gives me about a fifth of the population. Pr(14 \\u2264 Age \\u2264 20) = 0.05. It\\u2019s a pretty small number, I know, but Melbourne\\u2019s got an aging population so I figured it for around there.   Okay, so if a girl were to be both hot and within the age range, the probability of that would be 0.015. Which is about 1.5%. Now I don\\u2019t know about you, but I think that\\u2019s a pretty accurate number. God. That\\u2019s fucking sad. Still, it\\u2019s a fact of life and we\\u2019ve got to move on.   Even then, forgiving all of that, as I mentioned before, using that number, there would be about 32,250 fine looking women in that age range. So where\\u2019d they all go?  That\\u2019s a fair amount of pretty ladies, more than enough for having two a day for the next 44 years. But as I said, where\\u2019d they all go? Okay, assuming there are 2.5 people to a house [on average], there would be about 1,720,000 houses in Melbourne. Which is again, about right. So that 32,250 divided by 1,720,000 gives me a figure of 0.01875. Plugging the numbers into my calculator, that means for about every 50 houses, give or take 4 houses, there should be a beautiful woman my age.   Now that\\u2019s a fucking fantastic thing seeing as I live in Hawthorn and houses are densely packed together. Heck, there\\u2019re probably 100 houses on my street alone. This brings to my mind, the obvious question \\u201cWhere is she?\\u201d  If anyone can answer that question, feel free to answer. I\\u2019m at a complete loss as to why my neighbourhood has a complete lack of fine women. If someone ever invents a HWSD [Hot Woman Seeking Device], I\\u2019m sure as hell going to be the first in line to buy it. I hate statistical anomalies.',\n",

       " u'Time for a light hearted post. The past few have been pretty damn depressing so I figured I change the tone of this blog. Plus the fact that I\\u2019m in a good mood sure helps.  Just spoke to my father and after consultation with my mother, we came to a deal for my future car. Oh sure, I realise that I\\u2019m only 16 and I can\\u2019t drive by myself till I hit 18 [which happens to be in a year and half time but oh well].   If all goes well [and by that, no fucking around, good behaviour on my part not to mention a kick ass VCE score], I\\u2019ll end up driving a spanking new Lexus IS200. Or IS300 if I\\u2019m lucky. Extra lucky, but hey, an IS200 would suit my needs just fine.   Of course, this sparks dreams of what I\\u2019m going to do with the car and I think the first thing I\\u2019d probably do [apart from putting in a new CD/MP3 player unit plus new speakers] would be to get a personalised license plate. Research shows that it\\u2019d cost me around 300 dollars. Which\\u2026 is a substantial amount of money for a metal plate but it\\u2019s not like I have a choice.   Frankly, I\\u2019d like to put in PIMPIN. After the song P.I.M.P., but I know I\\u2019ll get endless amounts of shit for it seeing as not many females would be riding in my car. Still, it bears nice thoughts. LUVVYA would be less ostentatious but it\\u2019s more of a girl thing.  The license plate being the second thing people look at when you drive up [the first being the car itself and the third being the driver. \\u201cIs he hot?\\u201d], I need something with neutral connotations. I definitely need more than 6 characters but seeing as Victoria [I hate that name] won\\u2019t allow me to put in more than that, I\\u2019ll have to compromise.  So, I think I\\u2019ll settle on something like JAYTAN or something to that effect. Enough to proclaim that it\\u2019s my car and yet, not flamboyant [although putting in a personal license plate is pretty flashy in itself]. Ah, I\\u2019ll figure something out later.   *Dreamy sigh*. And now, Chris is thinking to himself \\u201cJono\\u2026 Always \\u2018what\\u2019 but never \\u2018how.\\u201d Ah, but this time is different. I\\u2019ve figured How I\\u2019m going to do it already. Good behaviour shouldn\\u2019t be too difficult and the only thing that worries me would be the excessive amounts I\\u2019ll be going out and the omnipresent risk of being busted smoking. Again. I\\u2019ll have to take extra precautions with that of course, and I\\u2019ve already had a number of ideas of how I\\u2019m going to conceal it. Smelling salts in the car, packets of tobacco taped under tables and copious amounts of deodorant.   It\\u2019s all good.',\n",
       " u'The teen movie that started it all. This movie will live on forever in history as succeeding generations of teenagers carry on the traditions taught to us in this film. I wonder how teenagers in future would look at it. I mean, sure, parties sure as hell aren\\u2019t filled with truckloads of beautiful babes. In fact, more often than not, we\\u2019d be lucky to get 10% of the girls actually decent looking. Then again, who am I to talk. I\\u2019m no Adonis myself.  Anyhow, as most of you can tell, I just finished watching Part 2 of the trilogy. Almost like Lord of The Rings, but perhaps making a bigger impact on us because we relate it to it better than a Halfling trying to throw a gold ring into molten lava.   Personally, the second instalment was my favourite one. I used to dream that the high school friends I\\u2019ve made would be like that. An unbreakable cabal brought together by circumstance and united by friendship. Perhaps, if not for some of the mistakes I\\u2019ve made [I think of one particular one, which was a mistake in more than that one way] it would have been a realistic dream.   I remember, fondly, of times spent discussing after school plans. I remember one in particular, that we, as a bunch, would drive down to a friend\\u2019s beach house in Sorrento. Alcohol would flow in abundance, cigarette packs would be stacked chest high and seeing as we were all single back then, we thought things would remain the same. Complete freedom from the shackles of love and perhaps we might\\u2019ve brought a few of our lady friends along. Chances are that we wouldn\\u2019t have, but it was a nice thought to bring them along. I still remember, vividly, that I said I\\u2019d be Santa Porn for awhile and be in charge of bringing the ah\\u2026 adult entertainment. No names of course, but someone was to drive and someone else was to bring the beach volleyball. We could all foresee great and memorable times ahead of us. Drunkenness and lecherous behaviour would rule the day, immorality would reign supreme, but in the end\\u2026 it would be a time we would never forget.   Now, I wonder how many of us remember that dream. When we look back on in 10 years time, what memories would we have? I made the mistake [one of many, I assure you] of not taking any pictures of the times I spent with my friends. I have nothing to remember my high school times by. Half of the year has already elapsed and yet\\u2026 all I remember of this year, or the outstanding bits are times of heartbreak, disappointment and frustration. It\\u2019s sad how it turned out this way. I guess, back then, not even a year ago, I was young and childish in dreaming that friendships last forever.   Even now, I feel the onset of tears in my eyes. Something which I haven\\u2019t had in a long time. Even lost love wasn\\u2019t able to bring this about but this\\u2026 empty promises and broken dreams. I feel pangs of regret, things I should have done and things I should not have done.   As you read this, friendships are broken in school. Past graduating years of Scotch Collegians had a group of Asians, seeing as we segregate ourselves automatically according to race, and most of them are friends, albeit not as close, even today. I wonder though, after the year is over, how many of the people would I call? How many would call me?   The very thought of this saddens me. What was once a group of young men wanting to have good times, wanting to remain friends forever. I don\\u2019t see that anymore. I see a group of immature bitches who have more interest in schoolboy politics than anything else. I accept that people bitch, but is this really necessary? Again, I have reservations on how many people see this.  The group is fractured, split and turned against one another. Not many have nice words to say about each other and the other who has left the Asian clique of friends has seen it as well. Sad to say, he couldn\\u2019t care less what happened. I guess, I care more seeing as my skin remains the same colour as them, but I find it disappointing that we could be like this. Each of the individual people I\\u2019ve had the misfortune to speak to have realised this. No one trusts one another anymore.   Just think, wouldn\\u2019t it be nice, if we were all friends again. Ready to stand for each other and where for once, harmony would reign. I accept that there would be differences between people, but perhaps not as much as we do now. Wouldn\\u2019t it be fantastic if we could say \\u201cHe is my friend\\u201d without having a shadow of doubt over those words? Just those simple words and people find it hard enough to say. How great would it be if we could say \\u201cFriends Forever\\u201d and know that there\\u2019s an honest chance of it coming true. That we would all remain friends forever, that we would never lose touch and we would never separate.   It\\u2019s pathetic really. But alas, what can be done? People place too much stress on their self pride nowadays, unwilling to make up and to say \\u201csorry\\u201d. I know I do. Plus, the fact that we\\u2019re all in the final year of school, while making this all the more important, ensures that we don\\u2019t have the time to do anything about it. The already strained bonds of friendship we took so long to forge throughout the years have already snapped.   We\\u2019ll all move on, we won\\u2019t slow down. We\\u2019ll make new friends and we\\u2019ll all go on with our lives. We accept things as they come and as our lives change. But\\u2026 when we look back, one, two, three, maybe even six decades from now, would we regret this? I know I would. My memory might fail me in my later years, but for the time being\\u2026 I know they won\\u2019t fade. But what memories do I have of this year?',\n",
       " u'All of us have taken part in charities every now and then, most of us playing the part of donors, but I guess when we feel particularly generous, or are forced to by the school, we become unwilling volunteers and go out there to collect money for the children of some forgotten land.   But I wonder, what\\u2019s the real point of charity? You think the $20 you give to the Red Cross every year is going to help the poor starving masses of Africa when countries like America dump thousands of tonnes of grain into their rivers to ensure fucking Farmer Bob in Kansas can afford to have an extra fireplace in his 30,000 hectare ranch? Or when bitching farmers in Australia get paid extra to produce less meat so that the CEO\\u2019s of Coles can buy a brand new Mercedes SL500? Good one.   The world\\u2019s definitely going the right way isn\\u2019t it? Oh sure, I\\u2019m quite guilty of those charges. I do chuck my half finished piece of steak away into the bin because I\\u2019m a vain fudgepacking bastard and wish to become slim. I do buy two chocolate croissants when one would suffice for no other reason than the fact that they\\u2019re fucking tasty. I pay a good amount of money more for clothes which I think look good rather than clothes which meet my necessity. Not to mention leaving my lights and stereo on because I like the atmosphere they provide although I don\\u2019t pay attention to the music and I\\u2019m not in my room.   I\\u2019m guilty of all that. So sue me. The mere fact that you\\u2019re reading this means you\\u2019re almost exactly like me. You\\u2019re using the internet, an extravagance according to most people in this forsaken world of ours. Chances are you\\u2019ll be using the phone later, automatically putting you in the top 10% of the world\\u2019s population seeing as 50% have never made a phone call. It\\u2019s really quite pathetic isn\\u2019t it?   Here\\u2019s some more. I\\u2019m proud to say I\\u2019ve never known neither hardship nor starvation. I bitch and complain about having restrictions sure, but I\\u2019ve never had to go hunt my next meal. I\\u2019m proud to say I have someone washing my clothes for me and don\\u2019t have to support 10 starving mouths. I\\u2019m especially proud to say I can take a Panadol pill when I\\u2019ve got a slight migraine in the morning and have never had a flesh eating bacteria slowly consuming my arm.   I\\u2019m fortunate and so are you. Appreciate it. Help those masses out there who aren\\u2019t as fortunate as we are. Come to think of it, most of you are in private school. I can think of one exception [or two actually. You know who you are] but one of you gets, or used to get, more money in a month than most people earn in six. We\\u2019re very fortunate people here. So go help those who really need our help.   How do we go about doing this? Frankly, I\\u2019m not sure if the money you donate to charity is any help. For some reason, of all the millions that have been given over the years, I don\\u2019t think anything\\u2019s changed in the country. Of course, this could be through sheer ignorance, but I have it on source from a person who went on a mission trip to Faridabad, India, that over 6 million dollars had been put into that little shanty town. And not one single fucking school. Not to mention the food packages given to the villages of savannah Africa. I still don\\u2019t hear any news of them. But maybe that\\u2019s just me.   I say we pressure the leading world nations of the world into doing something about it. If we spent half the amount of money we do on fucking thermonuclear warheads on helping the needy, we might get somewhere. Isn\\u2019t that wonderful? We\\u2019re killing two birds with one stone. First off, we reduce the amount of weapons in the world and create and oh-so-wonderful utopian paradise for all of us. Plus, the chance of us wearing fallout masks and radiation suits out to the front yard would be significantly reduced. Also, we get to improve the welfare of the needy people in Mongolia or some other God-forsaken third world backwater country.   Man. I should be president.   Thank you for your time.',\n",
       " u'In one of my complete-strike-at-random sullen moods and how do I deal with it? Express how I feel by writing on a site which as many people as I have fingers have the URL to. God I\\u2019m sad. Anyhow, reading through another Jonathan Kellerman novel [my third one], something mentioned by one of the characters struck me.  Well, two things, both of which were loosely linked to each other. One was misanthropy; the concept of. Wait. Maybe I better define misanthropy first. Reading through the dictionary, it\\u2019s defined as \\u201chatred or distrust for mankind\\u201d. Maybe we all feel like that sometimes, just world weary and cynical. I know I do. Anyway, there were two chief schools of thought. One by Swift and the other by Pope. One hated mankind as a general structural unit but yet managed to like individuals. The other was the reverse, disliking each link of the chain although incomprehensibly able to love the chain as a whole.   One of the more famous and more\\u2026 pro active misanthropists was a fellow known as Carl Panzram. Now, Carl over here just hated mankind and was one of the most well known serial killers of all time. I say was because of the sheer fact that we know his name, he was hanged, his last words to the world a big \\u201cFuck you\\u201d. Carl was a brilliant person and was one of the more genuinely hard-done-by-society-and-has-a-real-reason-to-take-revenge kinda person. But this isn\\u2019t about him. I\\u2019ve introduced him and I\\u2019ll be using him later, just be patient.   The next thing that raised questions in my mind were the concept of Limits. Not limits in the sense of the word of \\u201cI can\\u2019t jump 2 meters like Jordan can\\u201d or \\u201cI\\u2019ve only got an IQ of 140\\u201d. It\\u2019s more the limits of right and wrong. Your conscience. Let\\u2019s skip the peashooters and bring out the big guns. Murder. What we perceive as the most severe of all crimes. For example, all of us [or those who shower anyway] kill millions of organisms every single time we step into the shower. Although insignificant, a bacterium still possesses Life. Others still, have no qualms about killing ants, bugs, spiders, maybe even snakes. Ah, then when it comes to larger animals like birds or cats or dogs, the buck stops there for most females. Moving on, some people slaughter cows, pigs, goats and chickens for a living. Larger life forms and therefore considered more repulsive. Of course you get fisherman who kill dolphins and hunters who shoot elk and the list goes on. However, what distinguishes these life forms? Are they not all life? For whatever subjective limits we impose on ourselves, like \\u201cNo killing things with a vertebrae\\u201d or \\u201cDon\\u2019t kill cute animals\\u201d, we all have our limits when it comes to Death. I think I\\u2019d be safe in saying that all of us would not kill for the sheer sake of killing. But what divides a human from a dolphin? Or an ant? Hitler [most psychologists classified the man as a psychopath] revelled in the killing of Jews and homosexuals but cringed at the sight of someone kicking a dog. This seeming reversal of values is considered revolting because we, the vain homo sapiens believe ourselves to be superior to all other life forms on Earth. As such, we learn from a young age that the slaughter of another human is unforgivable and perhaps that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s considered the worst crime someone can commit [Except in America, where smoking marijuana gets you a harsher sentence than murder. But hey, it\\u2019s America]. Of course, there are punishments worse than death, but we can\\u2019t really compare seeing as those who are dead can\\u2019t talk anymore.   And here\\u2019s where Mr Panzram comes in. He had no limits or distinguishing factors, believing that the taking of a human life was insignificant and seeing as he was the one who actually committed the act with a knife or whichever murderous utensil he happened to have and not from a vintage oak desk on the phone to Himmler, I suspect Panzram would have been more of a psychopath than Hitler, only that he lacked the means to be on such a grand scale of state sponsored murder.   Imagine now, with teenagers reading books stored in school libraries about these men and then having access to firearms as nations allow a mentally disturbed 18yr old to purchase a .50 Desert Eagle whereas prohibiting a 50yr old security guard who stole a candy bar as a kid [and let\\u2019s face it. Who hasn\\u2019t done something illegal] from purchasing a .22 hunting rifle for quail.   Who said the world was getting better? We actually have kids who look up to psychopaths as role models.  Heil Hitler.',\n",
       " u'Spending my Friday night at home alone watching the MTV Movie Awards 2004, I\\u2019m naturally a bit bored. Between working out during the adverts and reducing my brain to rot with watching the shows, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice a certain advertisement   While others might not have noticed, me being the racist bigoted person I am, the new Toyota advertisement made an impression on me. Toyota, as the name sounds, is a Japanese company, or last I checked anyway. The funny thing was that it had Steve Irwin, who prides himself on being an Australian, as the star of the advert. I wonder if the executives over in Japan ever thought about that. Or Steve Irwin\\u2019s public relations manager. Supposing he had one, seeing as any PR manager, no wait, any reasonable person would have told him not to do the following.  I might not be entirely accurate with my facts so feel free to correct me, but if memory serves me right, Steve Irwin was almost awarded the Australian Of The Year award. However, the dolt, with a stupidity I find disturbing, dangled his toddler child over an enclosure filled with one of the two oldest, most ancient and most perfect predators in the world. The other being the shark, but that\\u2019s not the point.   So this dumb ass finds himself disqualified from that award but cuts a deal with a Japanese car company to appear on one of their adverts. I don\\u2019t know about you, but I guess coming from overseas, I\\u2019ve always looked at Steve Irwin as a representative of Australia, and for all his lack of brains and for having one of the most annoying accents in the world, would have been an ideal model for Australia. I don\\u2019t follow. Oh shouldn\\u2019t he be on a Holden advert you say? Well, Holden\\u2019s actually owned by GMC [General Motors Company], an American company. Then again, it\\u2019s not the only \\u201cAussie\\u201d company owned by an overseas corporate.   However, no I\\u2019m not all bitter. In all, the MTV Movie Awards was very entertaining, certainly a highlight for TV this year. Definitely worth staying at home for; oh go on laugh. I know I didn\\u2019t have a choice.',\n",
       " 'Being in the final year of school can be stressful and I think the one thing which most of us lack [or want more of at any rate] would be motivation. You hear it all the time \"Oh damn, I\\'m so unmotivated\", \"Shit, I need to study harder but I can\\'t be fucked\". Yeah you know the usual slew of phrases you hear so often from frustrated school kids.  Anyhow, me being the curious person that I am, I wondered where motivation was derived from and here are some of my thoughts. Many of my contemparies [myself included] work due to incentive. Some are promised a car, others cash bonuses and what have you. Generally, they are objects of great value to the person and hence is traded for good results. Usually, these gifts are material and have great tangible value. However, this brings images to mind of a donkey walking to get a carrot. And I know who\\'s the donkey.  Others work for a sense of satisfaction, and with the Incentive scheme, earning that reward gives you that sense of satisfaction, where you\\'re happy and feel pleased with yourself. There are those who work for intangible things, and by work, I don\\'t always mean academically, and try to get them. The intangibles might include say, a sense of self worth or one of those fuzzy feelings we get from doing a good deed.   Like now, it\\'s about 1.30 in the morning and I\\'ve got school tomorrow and I\\'m up chatting to this lady, who happens to be a rather beautiful one, which probably explains my sudden determination to stay up and to keep typing away.   Motivation or foolishness. Sheesh.',\n",

Like when two lovebirds have been separated, the time spent in anticipation only heightens the actual experience of being together. I guess it\\u2019s intriguing, but only to be expected out of two people going through a chaotic swirl of raging emotions.

       " u'I\\u2019m home alone and fucking bored. What do I do? I read. And then I write on what I read.  The purpose of this entry however, is not to explain my current condition, it\\u2019s much too trivial a thing to write about. However, reading a novel, and quite an excellent one at that [wouldn\\u2019t you know it. I have the dandiest luck, picking a romance novel randomly] caused me to wonder about the coming about of human emotions.  For example, I wonder about the genesis of our emotions. Would it be the fact that we think and therefore we feel that enables us to experience underlying and tender emotions for others? While some of us might hypothesize that it also enables the strong and raw feelings of hatred, we view violence in the savage and untamed animal world all the time. Whether that violence is brought about by instinct or bad behaviour by the animal is another matter. [I\\u2019d use evil, but I\\u2019ve mentioned before that it\\u2019s a very theologically burdening word and who\\u2019s to say that animals have a grasp of the simple and na\\xefve views we have on good and evil].  We see this all the time, people in love, people who hate, people who are indifferent and even those who are on some level, in the range of the spectrum but on neither extreme. I think this would have been the first time I actually ceased and questioned myself \\u201cWhy do we do the things we do?\\u201d. Psychologists believe it is a cocktail of nature and nurture; people are the way they are because of their genes and environment. Let me elaborate, a child born to a violent father, drunken mother and exposed to a torturous cycle of abuse and neglect would quite naturally, have different views to the world as opposed to your typical blond haired, blue eyed angel, brought up with two loving parents who are your stereotyped pay-our-taxes-and-Ned-Flanders-is-our-role-model pair of parents who gave all they could to her. In my analogy, I shall use \\u201cHim\\u201d as the miscreant and \\u201cHer\\u201d as the perfect child; a tribute to the fairer gender. =)   Would He have resulted the way he did if he were to be in Her environment? One might even surmise that it would be due to his testosterone, the stupidity-inducing male hormone that caused him to behave the way he does. The world reels in shock when a six-year old Him spits venom and talks of crucifixion but sighs in softness when a six-year old Her plays with her toy ponies.   But if we proceeded to place Him in Her environment and vice versa, would the results have been any different? Or would there be a compromise of the two? It is a known fact, that males tend to be much like their fathers, or so they claim. I beg to differ, being so different from my father myself\\u2026 However, such is not the subject of discussion and I beg your pardon for my divergence. The point I\\u2019m trying to make, or rather the question I\\u2019d like to ask is \\u201cWhy are we who we are?\\u201d It\\u2019s of course, exceptionally difficult to find out when we accept that no two people are the same and could turn out completely different. We hear of extraordinary people all the time, those who are in the worst of circumstances and yet manage to succeed where others in far more fortunate positions have failed.   To be continued when I can be bothered.',\n",
       " u'I arrived back in Melbourne early Wednesday morning, at about 4am and here I am back. Went to Mt. Buller yesterday for a spot of skiing and snow fun and well\\u2026 It\\u2019s interesting, playing in the snow, fun and yet intriguing at the same time. For all I know, it could\\u2019ve been [God forbid] someone\\u2019s condensed piss falling down in a popsicle and me playing with it as if it were pure.  Anyhow, as a result of the biting cold yesterday, my lips are chapped to fuck. Dry, cracking and generally unpleasant, both to behold and to be in possession of. Ah well, these physical ailments will go away but soon.  Of late however, something\\u2019s been bugging me more so than the other things. Not only are the VCE examinations a mere 3 and a half months away [OH MY FUCKING GOD!] but I haven\\u2019t been as hardworking as I should be. But alas, that\\u2019s not the main thing on my mind.   Interestingly [or to me at any rate], I\\u2019m dreaming far more than I usually do. I mean, it\\u2019s scientifically proven that we dream twice a night [we don\\u2019t always remember our dreams which explains why you might or might not know about that] but I find myself dreaming about 4 to 8 times a night, always about completely unrelated things. Some trivial, some weird and some just plain fucked.   For example, last night, I dreamt I was a champion, award winning snowboarder. Which I can understand how it came about, seeing as I went to the snow in the day and since snowboarding is so fucking cool. Or I think so anyway, sliding down a slope on little more than a fancy designed and aeronautically optimal piece of fibreglass or wood. After that, I mentally travelled back to Singapore, to be with someone whose name I can\\u2019t even remember. As in, I was spending a whole day with her [hey, you didn\\u2019t think I\\u2019d dream of a him now would you]. I woke up from that one, needing to take a midnight slash [First thoughts: What the fuck!?]. I gave it no more thought, proceeding to fall back into Dreamland again. Next dream was a little weirder. I was walking in a desert with the landscape looking like it was designed by Tolkien, the author of Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, it wasn\\u2019t the beautiful city and architecture of fucking Helm\\u2019s Peak or the elfish city, but more the drab and satanic landscape of Mordor. When someone like me, who detests Lord of the Rings starts dreaming about it, you know something\\u2019s wrong.   The next dream, I don\\u2019t want to talk about. That one was just plain wack and I can\\u2019t even begin to describe it. Well, I can, but I choose not to. I claim ineloquence. In fact. I don\\u2019t want to talk about the next 3. those, I\\u2019ll leave for myself. Keep in mind however, that the dreams didn\\u2019t appear in that order, I can\\u2019t remember the order in which I dreamt them [c\\u2019mon. It was in the wee hours of the morning and I didn\\u2019t give it much thought till I woke up]  Anyway. How\\u2019ve you been?',\n",

Are you saying that I\\xb4m not tellin the truth? Denying what she told me You know you got way too much to lose You\\'re claiming they are rumours You say you got nothin else to hide How come she told me? She saw somebody by your side    *Sigh*.

I mean, it wasn\\'t awkard and the lovebirds weren\\'t retreating into their own little world, everyone was talking and stuff. But it still got me thinking I guess. I figured I miss having someone there for me, someone whom I could really be myself around and to just give -her- a hug, one of those long embracing ones and release my pent-up emotions.  Then again. I never really did that with the one girlfriend I had or any of the other girls where there was something more than friends. I\\'d call it a fling, but that\\'s generalizing and probably unfair on some of the girls seeing as in one or two of the cases, there actually were underlying feelings involved. Enough.  I remember having a crappy day at school or having a controversial issue in my life, after which I\\'d receive a message from -her- or -her- saying \"I miss you\" or \"I love you\". I reckon that always, without a doubt, made my day and caused a smile to appear on my face.   Then again. I don\\'t even know what I want. I guess... It\\'ll come when it does. Whatever it is. Whatever I\\'m looking for. Which at this point of time, would probably be material things. Like a new phone. And the San Antonio Spurs jersey I saw. And the Nike Dunk Hi\\'s I saw.

       " 'Here\\'s an example of how my school views me.  A few days before, I was discussing with a friend about the genesis of violence. Like whether it was nature or nurture, basically why people kill other people and assault and all those kind of actions. Not very nice things to do, but people do it anyhow. The debate then turned to a discussion of who among us students was most likely to commit violent acts and if so, how they would go about doing it.  The obvious weapon of choice [or for me at any rate] would be a weapon like a flick knife. A baseball bat, while useful, would be too conspicuous and hard to conceal, hardly the kind of thing you\\'d want to bring to school. A gun would be nice for its unrivalled killing power, but I can\\'t touch one of those till I hit the big 1-8. Or at least not legally anyway. In any case, a gun would make too much noise unless I could lay my hands on a silencer. Not that I\\'d invest all that much money in ammunition anyway. And hollowpoint bullets, my ammunition of choice, is outlawed in most countries. Nunchakus are hard to use and require a degree of training to utilize proficiently. Okay, so we settled on flick knife.  So, unknowingly, I asked my tutor what would happen if a student were to bring a weapon to school. He then went on to ask \"What kind of weapon? Anything could be used as a weapon\". Fair enough, so I said \"A weapon like... a flick knife. Or butterfly. Something like that.\" He then went on to talk about the legal proceedings and how the weapon itself was illegal in Australia anyway. Simple and expected.  The following day, I get called up and get my locker checked. Would you believe? They checked my locker for just asking about the consequences for bringing a knife to school. I don\\'t know about you, but I don\\'t think I\\'d be the type to bring a knife or any weapon for that matter, to school. It\\'s too damn risky, plus, I really have no need to use weapons. I\\'d rather use my bare fists.  What bothers me is the principle behind the incident. I think I can safely say that if any other student were to ask an innocent question like that, nothing would have happened and the question would either be dismissed or answered. And that would be that.  But me? C\\'mon. I\\'m not a psychopathic and I sure as hell don\\'t have a problem with violence. The last time I got into a fight was... okay fine. Two days ago, but the stupid fuck cut my hair. And all I did was just push him around. Oh sure, if you wanna get technical, there was last week, but the dumb shit wrecked my tie and my hair [which I took the trouble of doing in the morning] so he got what was coming to him. Thing is, the school didn\\'t know about that and even if they did, I sure as hell wouldn\\'t bring a knife to school.  Which raises the question, how does the school view me? Just a little analysis from this incident and shit, it\\'s like the school perceives me exactly as I\\'m not. The world\\'s gone crazy.',\n",
       " u'Finally, some spare time to write a little something. I just got my VCE mid year exam results today and\\u2026 needless to say I\\u2019m pretty fucking pissed at it. All those Saturdays spent studying my unfocused butt off, all those hours wasted and what do I have to show for it? A score worse than my biology paper last year which I know I could not have been less prepared for. So, if such were the case, and the less I study, the better I do, no wonder why I fucked up all my results for this semester.   I got dual B\\u2019s on both psychology and physics. For physics, I was kinda expecting a C or C+ maximum, so I guess I\\u2019m not too unhappy with that. However, psychology\\u2026 this was a depressing mark. It irks me how for most of the year I had been going relatively well for this subject [through SAC results and all] and the end result is a big B.   What annoys me about this is that the other guy and I who had been going well throughout the year both did poorly in this paper. Maybe I shouldn\\u2019t have left the exam hall in 20 minutes huh? I knew I should\\u2019ve worked through all of it\\u2026 Oh well. It\\u2019s over and there\\u2019s one more round of examinations to redeem myself and hopefully, just maybe, Law school is still a dream within my grasp. I don\\u2019t want it to be just that\\u2026 just a dream.  Still, I think I shouldn\\u2019t have mucked around so much last term and instead prioritized my objectives. I sure as hell shouldn\\u2019t have focused on women so much, or clubbing, or socializing. Too many \\u201cifs\\u201d. I\\u2019m just going to go out and do this thing.  New found motivation by the way; no longer shall I use a female as my incentive [they\\u2019re too damn unstable]. I\\u2019m going to use material goods. I\\u2019m a greedy motherfucker and I\\u2019m going to exploit this to the max of my ability. See, I admit I\\u2019m a bit of a spendthrift, rarely saving any money unless it\\u2019s a super special occasion [by that, I mean for someone whom I really really really really really really really really like. That\\u2019d be pretty much the only reason why I\\u2019d save up.] and I like to enjoy life by splurging and buying on impulse. However, my parents are not able to provide for me forever and sooner or later I\\u2019m going to have to leave this comfortable nest of mine and go out to earn my own money. Which really sucks. Not only that, I figure, we\\u2019ve got a set amount of hours in a day right? And in those hours, I need to get as much money as possible. Basically, I want maximum output with minimum input. Therefore, I need a high-paying job.   I thought of being a gigolo for awhile before the prospect of fucking the women who can\\u2019t get any [and think about how easy it is to get a male in bed. And then think about the fact that these women can\\u2019t get any. It really does say something doesn\\u2019t it? Oh sure, there was the whole moral, integrity thing, but that lasted a fleeting second]. That idea went down the drain, ne\\u2019er to be seen again, but not before ruining the likelihood of me cracking a boner for the next 50yrs or so.   Selling drugs would be a high paying gig too, but that breaks one of the rules that I have. Yes, I do adhere to a set of rules, albeit ones which I bend to my needs and whims. They\\u2019re probably more guidelines than rules, but anyhow\\u2026 I couldn\\u2019t do it, knowing that I might be ruining the life of some kid somewhere and cause some family a lot of grief. I\\u2019ve already given my family enough grief, no need to give other families the sort of sadness mine has to deal with. I might, in future, just maybe, smoke a joint or two, but I doubt I\\u2019d ever get to the hard stuff [i.e. anything above marijuana. Which means ice, speedy, XTC, cocaine, heroin, you get the idea]. But that\\u2019s another thing.   But, that leaves the one option of me being an assassin of some sort. Killing other human beings or animals, I\\u2019m not particular, for tidy sums of money. Only problem with this is, I realise that because of the nature of the world now, I might have to kill some rich man or woman somewhere. Ordinarily, this wouldn\\u2019t pose a problem, however, what if they were to be the father of a friend, past, present and future? I\\u2019d hate to hurt my friends and moreover, I hate to make girls cry. Like it or not, with dead people, there are going to be a lot of spilt female tears, so that eliminates that job. Still, it\\u2019s probably the dream job of young males everywhere; being an ultra cool ninja assassin with the power of life and death. But, with great power comes great responsibility. Right? Fucking Hollywood. I\\u2019ve heard that one enough times. If there\\u2019s one person I\\u2019d shoot, it\\u2019d be\\u2026 no wait. Holy shit. There are a lot of people I\\u2019d like to shoot. Maybe not kill, but at least kneecap.   With that, I have only legal means left; which means Law school, which means I\\u2019ve got to study hard. Damn. Anyone know any other ways of making quick bucks with minimum input?',\n",
       " u'1am in the morning, raindrops falling heavily on my window sill, solitude, soulful music and an open mind. Everything I need for writing; if I were only in the mood.   This weekend has been one of ceaseless contemplation for me as I wander through my mental valleys and peaks, wondering when I would ever come to the end of my journey. Even then, this sojourn doesn\\u2019t seem to make sense at any one point of it. It\\u2019s such an abstract world, where everything has ethereal qualities and nothing seems to be real.   I remember once, as a child, I woke up thinking that I was the one human being in this world. That this world was created specially for me and every other person on this planet was just\\u2026 an angel of some sort, an interactive character whom I could relate to. Kinda like a computer game, where you\\u2019re the one main character and everyone else is just some sprite which helps or stops you from completing the game. I just wonder if all this is real, if everything I\\u2019m doing actually has some impact.   It\\u2019s like taking a walk in the dark, where you don\\u2019t know where you\\u2019re going or when you\\u2019re going to get there. The walk itself makes no sense as you have no sense of direction, inching and feeling your way forward, searching for a light switch which might not even exist.   When walking, there\\u2019s always the burning question \\u201cWhat if I stub my foot on something\\u201d and this applies to our walk through the darkness. With no sense of direction, nothing to hold on to and no light to show you a path, it\\u2019s hard to walk. But walk we must.',\n",
       " u'I\\u2019m going to try to be a verbal artist here; I\\u2019m going to paint you a picture of a city. This is an imaginary city. A city where trains are broken and trees are stripped bare. The weather is cold enough that you can see your breath when you exhale and where the smoggy atmosphere permits minute amounts of light to come through. It is dark for most of the day, the only bright hours in the afternoon, and then again, only for 8 of the 24 hours available in the day.   The buildings themselves resemble their citizens; old, weary and vandalized. Graffiti streaks down the walls at every corner, every traffic light and every sign post. It\\u2019s a city of hustlers and pimps, where thugs control the streets and pushers and doped out junkies are about as numerous as pimples on an acne-struck teenagers face. Ecstasy changes hands in open daylight and the parents steal marijuana from their children. The kids carry 9mm handguns in their sport bags with a flick knife in their shoes. Basketball practice requires you to bring your gun along with you, in case someone else moves in on your court and a confrontation results. More often than not, weapons are drawn and someone\\u2019s blood is spilt. This is a place where the criminals outgun the police. Where the police had .22 handguns and stun batons, the youths had 12 gauge shotguns and grenades.  During the night, when the gangs come out to do battle, the high pitched sprays of Uzi fire punctuated by the deep bass boom of a shotgun plays as the orchestra of the hours of darkness. Screams of anguish are heard and when daylight falls, the remnants of the rumble can be found as bodies remain and bullet holes are scattered on the adjacent walls.   It is a forgotten city, forgotten by the rest of civilization and its own citizens, where each man is truly an island and help is never extended to thy neighbour. Money is always in short supply and all excess is either spent on weapons or drugs. Occasionally, if one is feeling generous, he might bring a few friends to the strip parlour, where he would pay for a lap dance or perhaps\\u2026 extra services given after hours and off the record. Of course, not that you had to pay anyway, there is no shortage of young girls who\\u2019d do anything for you if you told them that you could get them of this hole. The success of a robbery determined whether someone\\u2019s child would starve to death tonight. You\\u2019re the luckier one if you\\u2019re looking down the wrong end of the barrel as you probably have no need to carry out the robbery in the first place.   It is a city with a spirit of desperation; each of the citizens desperate to run away but the question always remains, where to? There is nowhere for them to go, and they know it. Without anywhere to escape, escape is impossible. With most of the school teachers themselves shooting tar heroin into their arms, no one ever gave much thought to academia. The older generations were resigned to their fate, realising that they were doomed to stay in the same place for the rest of their lives and ambition had long left this suburb.   Pretty fucking bleak ey?',\n",

       " u'Can you remember the best or worst day of your life? Is it the same day? There is a single day of my childhood that stands out among the memories. I recall these events with great anxiety and fear, as well as great joy and relief. This day was among the best, and the worst. The day started out like most others. Then an unexpected chain of events lead to an unexpected conclusion. \\tAs a child in the second grade, life is typically care-free. Eight year old boys usually worry about the new G.I. Joe or Transformer action figure and play set. Getting on and off the school bus was my biggest responsibility. The school I attended would pick up the elementary students at the end of the day and bus them to the high school to wait for those students to board. This lead to about a ten minute wait for the elementary students, who were allowed to get off the bus and play in the courtyard until the high school dismissed. So with that ten minutes of freedom, my friend and I departed the bus and began to do what little boys do best, run and play. However, the daily routine would soon be broken. \\tThe routine went something like this. The high school students would dismiss and board the buses, followed by the roar of the buses diesel engines cranking up. This was our signal to find our way back to the appropriate bus and get on for the ride home. On this day, however, my friend and I took our time making the short trip back to our big, yellow mode of transportation. We bounced along kicking rocks, jumping from anything we could climb on, and playing in the dirt. For an eight year old boy, the shortest distance between two points is a skewed line. Our pace quickened, however, when we noticed the lead buses pulling away. Running up to our bus we found nothing but a folding, glass and metal door that was shut tight. I can remember the expression on the drivers face. Without a word she said it all, she was making a point, and no matter how much we beat on the door, she wasn\\u2019t going to open it. She just shook her head and said, \\u201cNo\\u201d.  My friend and I watched that bus, and many more pull out of the lot. I had never seen that lot empty, until now. It was an unfamiliar territory. \\tWe started to make our journey on foot, walking up a busy street that lead to the overpass and our neighborhood on the other side of the interstate. I remember being so scared of being run over or picked up by some evil person. The worst thought though, was what my mother was going to say or do. The awful and swift punishment I would receive couldn\\u2019t match being run over by a truck. Just before we made it to the overpass, my friends\\u2019 mother pulled up beside us. This was all made possible by my brother, who had made it onto the bus in the first place, and was already home. On the ride home, I tried to be as invisible as possible. My friends\\u2019 mother let us know how she felt about our adventure. She was not pleased. I knew that I would get the same treatment when I arrived home, and I was petrified.

My friends\\u2019 mother dropped me off at my house and I prepared for the worse. However, my wild imagination was wrong. There were no belts cracking, no beatings, no yelling or reprimanding. Only the smell of home-made pizza and the loving embrace of my concerned mother. She wasn\\u2019t mad, and she had made pizza for supper! That was too much, I didn\\u2019t believe it. \\tThat day in my childhood is, without a doubt, the worst and greatest.

       " 'Since my last post, i guess I should explain my love of H.R. Personnel, as it will make more sense for those who aren\\'t in the know. To put it blunty I don\\'t like H.R. people. Not the individual mind you, but the job. Really. Makes me vomit up bits of internal organs to even think about it. That said, here goes my spleen -      Before I go too far, let me re-verify my statement above, it\\'s not the individual, it\\'s the profession... I know programmers who love Visual Basic, I know people who prefer to eat their salads with salt and pepper, etc. Short explanation - even good people do bad things. It\\'s in our nature. However, I cannot understand the inherent evil that is the HR job.  Now more specifically, I really really dislike the recruiters.  The avg HR joe who takes my call about a question on insurance, dental plans, etc is doing just fine in my book. They serve a need and they do it the way they think best. Fine. But those smug faced, lie spewing recruiter types, well, damn.  If you ever go to a career fair, you\\'ll be surrounded by them, if you go to a college-style interview, you\\'ll meet them. Some companies make you go to meetings filled with them. if you haven\\'t met these types, count yourself lucky, and to try to help you spot them, I\\'ve written up some quick tell-tale signs :  Do they smile ALL THE TIME?  I mean, the kind of smile that looks like it was created by having the muscle fiber in their face altered, or maybe it\\'s one of those freaky clear plastic masks, whatever, it\\'s the first warning sign.  Do they talk really loud? are they exuding energy from their very pores? if so, another warning sign.      here\\'s the worst one though - if someone is singing a company song, call it done. Same deal if there is a company chant, company dance, company sexual position, whatever. In fact, if the company has a song or a chant they do at meetings, might want to consider a job move.  I\\'ve had my fair share of experiences with the HR Demon. I\\'ve had to write a report saying i was sorry (3rd grade anyone?) I\\'ve had to do a fucking dance. I\\'ve had to watch them cheer and run across the stages telling everyone how wonerful their slave-style job was.  However, one occurence will always stay with me.  I saw one of the college recruiters walking out of work one day. I was slightly behind and to the side of her, so she did not notice me, but I had a good view of her profile. She seemed kinda off for some reason, like she was in a hurry to get out or something. Noticing this, I decided to see what was up.  That bitch wore her widest ass shit-eating grin the whole 1/2 mile walk through the parking lot to her car. She gets in, shuts the door, turns on her air-conditioning.... slumps way down in her seat and just relaxes her facial musclies.  It was the most amazing thing I\\'d ever seen. The smile gone, she put her blazer in gear and headed home.  I almost felt sorry for her until the next week when she made myself and some other guys play a \"team-building exercise game\"  Evil bitch',\n",
       " 'OK, was talking to my boy Kaleb tonight, mentioned a recent career fair I\\'d been to here on campus, so here goes my take on it.  Career Fairs are pretty much bullshit. I say pretty much, cause every once in awhile, it has to do something for someone, or else why would people still go? maybe it\\'s like an urban legend for the unemployed college student, like \"I know this guy, who knew this guy who\\'s roommates dog\\'s groomer got a job through one\". Anyways, so here was my experience at my most current Career Fair visit:  I go in, dressed down by typical attendee standards, but dressed up by typical ComSci guy standards (slacks and a sportscoat, no tie, if you cared).  I had my handful of resume\\'s printed on the expensive, off-white paper that you\\'re supposed to (who started that trend anyways? what difference does it really make over standard 20# paper? probably a paper manufacturer, greedy bastards).  So I go and decide to whore myself out for a job op.  Now if you\\'ve never been to one of these before, let me explain the setup to you: a really big open room, full of folding tables with big signs proclaiming the name of the company, and lots of free crap like pens and hats and stuff. There are usually 2-4 reps per company there to tell you how great the company is, and answer your questions. These are not the people you\\'d work with most of the time but H.R. people. My close friends know my feelings about H.R. people, but that\\'s another story. So you go and say \"Hi, I\\'m such and such, I\\'m pursuing my degree in such and such, and I\\'d like to work for your Company, or one of any company here who\\'ll have me, I dont\\' really care\". They say \"great, let me see your resume\" and then either \"thanks, we\\'ll keep this around\" or \"we probably don\\'t have much for you right now, but I\\'ll hold on to it just in case\". Depending on your major they may just laugh you out and throw poo at you.  here\\'s where it gets really annoying:  case 1 - myself - B.S. in CS GPA of 3.11 - currently seeking my M.S. IN CS with GPA of 4.0 - here were the two most common answers for me - \"We can\\'t recruit for anything but entry level positions here, and we couldnt\\' do that for you, too much experience\" and \"wow, this looks great, but we don\\'t have any openings for IT people, and you\\'re probably not Management type\".  Wow.. neat... the first one really pisses me off, makes me think, you know, if your boss knew you passed up a willing experienced person who would work for entrylevel pay, would he fire you then or wait til your next performance eval?\"  but this isn\\'t as bad as:  case 2 - My sister - graduates this semester with her B.S. in history. ya, history, I know, no job right? but get this - she is a member of 4 different honor societies, has a 3.9 GPA and could rock your fucking socks off in just about any academic endeavor she wanted to. Most well read person I know, and a grand employee at the library. Now, I know she\\'s not the salesmen type, but I\\'m sure that your company could find some sort of position that she can handle. Do you not have any clerks, analysts, or researchers at your company? Jeez. the worst part was, not only did she only get to hand over 1 resume, 4 people told her straight to her face to go away, or brushed her off. How great is that?  Since half these companies can\\'t afford new blood, they were probably there to build goodwill... not a great way to go about that.  oh, and on our way out, I stopped by one last kiosk in hopes of gettign some kind of info - \"we have intern positions for H.R. only\" Christ.',\n",

Well, sorry folks, I\\'m not that cheery.  However, I had an interesting conversation tonight and I think I\\'d like to share it with you. It isn\\'t so much negative or positive, but I thought it was interesting, and if any of you wonder about how your Teachers and Teaching Assitants feel about classes, maybe it could give you some insight into their own thoughts and feelings.  I was up at my office this evening, grading a few papers, logging the grades and all that rot. Ya, did it on a Sunday evening, grades being distributed Monday. Graduate students forget that weekends exist, they\\'re just the days we don\\'t have to go to a class.   Regardless, a couple of other TA\\'s were there, and also a TA who has recently been appointed to a lecturer position.  A big rumor has apparently started to come up in the department, seems we may not have enough financing to pay for all the TA\\'s next semester, maybe not even enough for any of the Master\\'s students to work at all. Being a MS student myself, this does indeed concern me. We all started talking about our alternatives. My head TA, a fellow who started the same time as me and who I think totally rocks, said that he\\'d heard of students who abandon their college and quit being TA\\'s in the middle having a hard time returning to a program at said college.  He was afraid to go job hunting because of this, as it could require him to withdraw from the univeristy, and lose the good graces of the faculty.  At this point I began to wonder, \"who cares?\" I mean, if they can\\'t support us to help them teach their classes (and I think a lot of you would be surprised by how much a TA really does for their students, especially in a technical discipline)  why should we bother to give up oppourtunity to make them happy? At this point I found the rift between myself and my associate. I did not come into the Master\\'s program so that I could teach, I didn\\'t come into it because of my great love for learning in a university setting. I did it for two reasons - financial asylum, and expanding my potential job oppourtunities.  He also came seeking these things, but would like to be a professor later in his life.  At this point - the person who is now a lecturer chimed in with \"why I can\\'t say that I know for sure that you\\'ll be working next semester, it would still be a good idea to keep your prof\\'s happy\".  All of a sudden I wanted to scream.  you know, that warning lamp goes off in your head, your eyes cross, you get nauseated...  and I think. wait, he\\'s a lecturer, working on his PhD, here so he can become a Prof.  Then it made sense and I calmed down a lot.  You see it boils down to what we\\'re looking for. The lecturer needs his PhD.. that\\'s all there is to it, he plan on becoming a Prof immediately.  The head TA - he wants to work, got laid off like I did, and would also like to be a prof (when he retires from industry he says). Myself, I just want the market to get better so I can go back to the life I had.   While we\\'re all different on that, it makes sense, and we all know where we\\'re at.  Here\\'s where it got really neat though:  The lecturer mentioned how lucky we were to be TAing CS 1.  I immediately thought - what the hell are you talking about?  But the weird thing was that the Head TA agreed!  Now I had been complaining to a lot of my old buddies about CS 1.  It comes down to this:  They enjoy the challenge of getting people to learn something they dont\\' have the slightest understanding of.  I do not. I cannot stand the whining and complaining I get daily from the business students, the stat students, and everyone else. BUT I do enjoy teaching. I did it for free at my old high school while I was working at Worldcom. The difference  comes in that I like to teach those who are willing to learn.. who want it. because they don\\'t complain that the material doesn\\'t matter to them, that it is useless, and that they just want their C so they can go on. The people who want it are driven, or at least curious, and that makes all the difference.  What happens to us next semester? who the hell knows. What happens if we get job offers today, and are required to start next month? well, I for one would take it, tell my profs to kiss my ass, and go for it. I would love to complete it, and most likely would in my spare time.  The Head TA ? he\\'d be very conflicted. He\\'s extremely loyal, likes the institution of higher learning, and wants to make sure he keeps the prof\\'s happy. I told him to take the job, come back before he retires, all these profs will be dead or gone, and know one would be around to be mad that he\\'d left.  The lecturer? well he\\'ll probably stay anyways, and since his Degree is being paid for, he doesn\\'t have that much leverage.  One thing for everyone to remember please - TA\\'s are students on top of your little helpers. They sometimes write your assignments, they almost always grade them, and they are severly underpaid. Don\\'t blame them when you fail, don\\'t make fun of them for looking weird (try sleeping avg of 3 hours per night from working instead of partying) and for the love of god, show them some resepect.  Out.',\n",
       " 'well well well, I\\'ve been married for 2 years today. Neato.  thats the happy thought for today. Much too tired to keep that stuff up. Well, I\\'ve just finished the first round of tests for this semester, no matter what kind of college student you are, it feels good to be done with them. For me, it doesn\\'t help that I have more work to do than a cheap whore during shore leave.  I have papers, programming projects, grading, and all manner of family obligations to attend to.  So why am I here writing? cause it\\'s the easiest thing on the list to do.  Let me discuss this whole testing thing for a bit.  Lets get it straight - tests make up the majority of your grade. They are very short in length compared ot most of the other work done for classes (unless you\\'re a business major whose only coursework are the tests themselves, I took the classes, don\\'t pretend that\\'s not true, your ruse of \"group projects\" be damned). Exams are also a high-stress activity, usually preceded by much caffeine, nail biting, and overactive reading.  Now maybe my methods wont\\' work for a lot of you, maybe they will, but hell, here\\'s my advice to all you test takers, and even if you\\'re not taking tests, we all get quizzed from time to time.  Here\\'s what helps me (use at your own risk).  Wear comfy clothes.  No use being uncomfortable, trying to look good for the ladies (or guys as the case may be).  Trust me that no one else in class is checking you out during this test.  Being comfortable is the first part of being able to focus your mind.    Eat somethign earlier in the day, but do not eat right before the test.  You don\\'t want a gurgling belly irritating you, but you dont\\' wanna get all dreamland sleepy when trying to remember what the fuck the symbol for projection in relational algebra looks like (it\\'s a large pi symbol btw).    Don\\'t cram right before the exam. Take a freaking break and play some ping pong or something. Those last second mindscrapes usually end up confusing most of us.  It wouldn\\'t hurt to give a cursory glance through some examples right before the exam starts, but if it\\'s 2 hours beforehand, take a breather.  Studying the night before is cool tho.     Study groups only work if you actually study material.. They don\\'t work if you\\'re talking about bullshit.  It\\'s been my expereince that the majority of \"study groups\" turn into a social gathering in about 20 minutes. Either try to steer the conversation back to study, try to excuse yourself early, or plan ahead so that you can get your people thinking about any questions you have in that first 20 minutes.    Finally, when you\\'re taking the test - focus on it like a motherfucker.  If you don\\'t know the answer to one question skip ahead to the next, don\\'t waste time pondering until you\\'re certain you\\'ve got everything that is \"for sure\" down.  Then go back and do those other questions. for some people this is a time thing, but for me, sitting around trying to do something I\"m not sure of breaks my concentration, gets me out of that \"zone\".  Whichever, it\\'s a tried-and-true strategy.  That \"zone\" is your best mofoing buddy when you\\'re testing, you\\'ll be able to remember things, maybe even recall whole pages of diagrams and such.    Finally, don\\'t study too much. this is very possible, and will seriously screw you. go over your reading twice and be done with it. you have a question about something, get it answered, remember the answer and stop.  You can overstudy, and it will screw with your head.    Oh ya, and the best tip you\\'ll ever get - go to fucking class, and listen when you\\'re there. put down your calculator with the games, put down the palm pilot with your scribble drawings, hell, put down your pen and just listen. Profs arent\\' talking to hear themselves, they\\'d rather not be there either. but it\\'s what makes it work, and they know more than you do, I promise.  I don\\'t know that I\\'ve ever had a class where 90% of all the test material wasn\\'t touched on in class.     Another thing - studies show that you can do better on an exam if you can recreate the environment in which you studied the material. So if you learn it in class, all the better, but if you learn it on your own, try to minimize things that you have around you that you won\\'t have in class (like beer, loud music, and your computer screen).  I\\'m out.',\n",
       " 'Hello Bloggy blog. I know I haven\\'t posted in damn near forever, but I\\'m back with style now baby.  Well, lets catch you guys up a bit. I have done more work this last month than a man should in three.  I also have some important announcements regarding me:  1) I am now local ACM president at OSU, so bow down. 2) I got hired for a contract to work on a game that I\\'ve been looking forward to for a couple of years now (more on that in a bit) 3) all our puppies have been given good homes, and 4) I am still unemployed.  OK, now onto the more exciting bits of that - the game dev thing especially.  Back when I was a kid, my dad bought our first computer. It was a 286. It was wonderful.  We went through more than a few upgrades over the next few years, so I can\\'t remember which iteration of hardware we were on when I started playing the game that changed my young little life. The Bard\\'s Tale.  My goodness I loved that game. Played it for hours on end. Beat it and thought I was the biggest badass around.  It was first person oriented Computer RPG, similar to the wizardry series (but a bit more interesting in my opinion).  Anyways, I loved this game dearly. Fast Forward to 2 years ago - I find that there is a group of indy developers working a game that is \"loosely based\" on Bard\\'s Tale. I was ecstatic, I went and checked out the website and all that rot.  It looked grand and totally took me back to being an 11 year-old in front of dad\\'s PC.  So I joined up on the mailing list.  Well, I go back every few months, and the game does seem to advance (albeit slowly, these guys are all doing this in their spare time).  The game goes through some major revisions and all that.  Lately, it\\'s started too look like it\\'s getting close to being finished, and I toss off the random email offering my services to help test or even do some extra dev work they got layin around, as I want to get the ball moving so I can play this darn game.  They were cool about it and said they\\'d offer me some testing stuff.  A few weeks later lo and behold, I get an email saying, hey, we ran into a snag with one of our developers, you care to jump in and get some stuff doen for us?  Of course I jump on it, they said there were a few others who were interested, and they\\'d have to check into all of us, but in the end i got picked. So yippie yay me!  I\\'m rocking the hisouse now, and I\\'ll even get a share of the profits from teh game, so hey, even better!  anyways, the game  has a website at: http://www.devilwhiskey.com go check it out if you like.  I\\'m tired now, it\\'s a bit late. I\\'ll start posting a little more regularly, promise (things are certainly still busy in the gradschool front, but hey, it\\'ll be better soon).  Phil.',\n",
       " 'Just for Brian -  Whoop Donkey.  I got a job. Yup, that\\'s right. Neato, I\\'m employed!  So the big question is, do I stay in grad school? The answer - sorta. I dropped my daytime class (which I really really hated) and I\\'m keeping my nighttime course, which I only kinda hate.  Over the summer I will be doing nothing but working at my job and on that game, and then during the Fall semester I\\'ll take another nighttime course. we\\'ll see what happens from there.  Some might say \"there are only 3 weeks left in teh semster, why would you drop the course?\" to which I say \"cause it sucks\".  I wasn\\'t doing so well as it was, but it was just getting to be ridiculous.  How about some homework, some tests, and some massive programming projects still left in the semester for BOTH my classes.  OS2\\'s projects are immense, and frankly, I got better ways to use my time now. :D  So for those who care to know more, I\\'ll be working at a place here in stillwater called \"SST Software\". they do GIS systems for agriculture.  I\\'ll be learning to write .NET applications, which I have mixed emotions about, but I\"ll be doing it for a good salary, of which the only emotion I have is elation :).

       " 'Hello and welcome back.  Well, I\\'ve completed my first 2 days on the job, seems OK so far. I think I\\'m still catching a bit of \"the new guy\" cold shoulder from folks, but things were warmer on my second day as opposed to my first. I\\'m starting to get into the swing of things there.  Tomorrow will be an adventure, I get to work all day and then go to a 3 hour night class. We\\'ll see if I survive or not.  So I realized this weekend that I am one busy sombitch, check it - I have like 4 jobs! First there\\'s the new one - the full time bit at SST, then I have my TA responsibilities, and while that has been scaled down *significantly* from what it was, I still am grading papers and holding one office hour per week. The third is only an hour or two a week, but a responsibility to meet nonetheless, I\\'m tutoring a person in CS 1 / java programming so they can go to grad school at cornell and have a leg up on the program there.  Finally, i\\'m still doing the game dev thing, which rocks by the way, and I really hope something more could come of that.  Heck, maybe our game wil be a hit, and they can afford to hire some full timers, like me ;).  So anyways, add them up, that\\'s 4 jobs.  plus a night course for grad school, plus family commitments, ACM presidency, 2 dogs, and a new gamecube (heh).    Man, I can\\'t wait for the semester to end, that\\'ll help bunches. Think I\\'ll leave this one short, it\\'s late and this old working stiff needs to go to bed so he can get up at a decent hour tomorrow.  Later. Phil.',\n",
       " \"Holy Crap.  The air conditioning in our office at SST is apparently broken for the one single room that I happen to work in (we're upstairs and have a seperate air conditioner from the rest of the folks.  it's gotten as hot at 91 degrees F inside here today, and I'm about sick of it.  Having had a heatstroke this weekend, I'm kinda fearful of being in this heavy heat all damn day long, but so far, no problems.  Aside from that, my day has been dull.  Tired of a lot of things right now, wishing I could just go and curl up in a ball for a few days and come  out refreshed.  I realize that's not gonna happen, and such is life. Still sucks tho ;)  Our 2 dogs got out of the yard this morning, and we got another ticket for Dog at large (2nd time this has happened since we lived here, first time was like september last year).  Pretty annoying when you just did a lot of work on a fence and they still break out.. fixing that fence was what gave me the heatstroke in the first place. Bastards.  I'm thinking I may leave work a bit early today, with all the heat it's hard to think about much of anything, and I've had enough shit on my mind lately that's kept me from being able to focus as it is.  Mostly money stuff, you know how that old rot can be.  I'm thinking about writing a few programs and selling them on eBay, maybe a movie collecting program that I'm writing for myself, and perhaps I'll do that budgeting program for my church that dad wanted.  The game is still going strong btw, we should hopefully be finished with the public demo at the end of this month (July) or the VERY beginning of August  the site is still at  urlLink www.devilwhiskey.com  if you missed the link before now.  Good stuff, and we've come a long way with it.  Hope those of you who are reading this will enjoy.  Oh, and if you see me around, make me enroll in a grad course NOW. I haven't enrolled yet, and I'm realizing that I really should.  Phil.\",\n",

       " \"Thankfuly, our Air conditioning got fixed on Friday last week. That helped a lot. Having all kinds of fun at work with Web Services.   That part was serious. Internet Explorer is the best browser for my site there.   That part was NOT serious.  We require our users to use Internet Explorer.  Being an admittedly big-time mozilla firebird (formerly phoenix) fan-boy, I was kinda ticked about that.  I was even more ticked when I found out how crappy IE can be to develop websites for. Since we're using ASP.NET, we are really pretty much stuck with IE as a client browser, since Microsoft's Technologies tend to play best when they play together.  Unfortunately, MS's bastard child of a web browser doesn't play well with Cascading Style Sheets or PNG image files (you know, the standard way to format web pages, and the recommended Web Image format - according to the W3C).  CSS is horribly nasty in IE - but PNG is even worse.  See there's this thing called an alpha channel.  an alpha channel lets you determine how  transparent  or  opaque  an image is.  PNG's lets you specify it on a per pixel level, with varying levels of transparency across the image.   The only comparable popular graphic format we have on the web is GIF.  GIF's have only recently come out of a problem with the compression algorithm patent, which was a concern before.  But on top of that, the format is WAAY too dated.  You're limited to 256 colors, and the alpha support is really nothing more than an on/off switch for transparency - as in all or none.  So hey, PNG overcomes all those limitations, and they render great in every modern web browser, on every platform. Except for Internet Explorer on windows.  ya.  sucks...  even IE for Apple can render them properly.  Just not, you know, the biggest audience with the largest market share.  It can't quite do it.  So what's a web dev to do?   Hack it up. Seems there's a workaround using some direct X image style filter that ONLY works with IE, and isn't a real clean workaround.  But at least it does something  Sad sad day, that I'd be bitching about web design :(  on another note - the Game development is doing well, we're supposed to go code freeze for demo this weekend, we'll see if that happens.  I only really have one thing to work out now,  one last bard song implemenation.   We'll see if I can swing it in time or not..  I got 2.5 done this evening, even with changing the tire on my wife's car, and driving around town for a bit after I got off work to show her some places she's trying to scout out for employment.  This last bard song is a bit more complex than the others that I've done, but I shouldn't have much problem getting it done given an entire afternoon.  I'll post more details about everything once I get some more free time.  Phil.\",\n",
       " \"Oh Fortune how you mock me. Now the air-conditioning in my home is messed up. We have 2 window units - the one in our living room (that also gets the kitchen, bathroom, and hallway) is blowing warm air. The one in our bedroom still works OK, but it' pretty much does the bedroom only, and doesn't help much.  Time to call the landlord again.  Sad thing is we had it recharged like a week ago.  may be time for a new unit (yay).  I'd love it if she just put in central air, that'd make me smile, but I think there's about as much chance of that happening as there is a chance of me becoming a millionaire.  In which case I wouldn't be renting this little house anyways ;)  So the game dev is VERY near completion, we hoped to have code complete this weekend, doesn't look like that will happen, but demo-level code is complete on my end at least until the lead programmer gets his stuff in, and then I'll be able to finish off my last bit of demo-flagged code (hopefully that'll happen tonight).  I still have more stuff to finish before the game is done, but it's definitely the end now.  If what's left on my plate is all that's left, then I think I can finish it before school starts - which would be good since I won't have much time once school hits.  Oh - father-in-law may have hooked me up with a new contract now too.  Some company that needs a database mgmt system to track their inventory or something.  Apparently they've been managing the whole thing with a spreadsheet so far, and it's getting to be too big (HAHA, imagine that!)  so sounds like a simple database insert/update/delete form is all that is needed.  Heck, if they have access, and it's only one user, I won't even bother to make a full program, just do it with Access forms in an afternoon ;)  They were paying a PC tech like $300 to install/setup a PC so they must not be too scared to pay for their tech.

       " \"Wow.    Things kinda suck right now. But they're hella better than they were.  I have been the epitome of busy, tired and angry over the last couple of weeks, and it's really starting to show.  I hate it when things get like this, but the whole summer has pretty much sucked ass.  I know the people I work with have gotta think I'm one unlucky mother, and I hate to say it, but if you'd just been looking at my life since may of last year, you'd be right.  Here's a quick rundown of just a brief selection of the things I've had to deal with in the last 3 months. 1) Wife's car - broke down 2 times - once for the power steering pressure hose, and most recently (as in 2 days ago) the alternator went out 2) My car - broke down 2 times also - once was the heater core, second was the battery( 1 day ago).     for about 2 hours there, we had  0 drivable vehicles... now that sucked. 3)  Wife got laid off from her job at end of June  -   just recently started working again - still waiting on that first paycheck. 4)  After Shanna got laid off, we've visited the doctor or the hospital about 6 times.  the medical bills are really starting to pile up. 5)  Shanna had to have an emergency root canal on an abcessed tooth - no dental insurance (job's dental is pretty much worthless) 6)  Auto Insurance company who can't figure out how to properly charge a credit (debit actually) card and charge me twice what i actually owed. 7)  lack of funds in a big way.  With Shanna losing her job, me just starting one (that only pays once/month no less), all the doctor bills and car repairs... we're just barely squeezing by.   Shanna got a partial paycheck today, that is not enough to cover our next bill.   how we'll get past it until the end of the month is my current worry, and lord knows I have enough of that at the moment 8) Shanna's mom died 9) My grandfather (maternal) died. 10)  My sister (whose recent marriage was a highlight in this summer) is having trouble finding work - with a BS and a GPA of 3.98 to show for it too) 11) Game development is still going OK, but we're having trouble getting the last bits cleaned up.. some team members fell on some extraordinarily rough times, and that is causing troubles getting some content finished up. 12) I have trouble sleeping lately  (wonder why) 13) Loosing too much weight from the sleeplessness and the stress. 14) my dogs have fleas, and no medicated shampoo or flea collar seems to be helping the poor bastards.  Ick. Like the old quote goes tho, leave them with a great ending, and they'll feel like they had a good time (para.)  so here's the good things I've got going on: 1) still married 2) I'm employed - even if it's not my first pick, the job is getting better, and it's a good income 3) I'm working on a video game - and they finally got my name up in the credits.. now that's fucking cool no matter how you look at it. 4) even with all this I'm still managing to go to graduate school - class starts tomorrow for me (once/week) 5) my dogs are still fun and cute when they're not itching 6) my cars work now. and I was able to do most of those repairs myself, saved cash that way. (didnt' do the power steering hose, not enough time) 7) Shanna's got work now, and that's helping her out immensely 8) it's my birthday on Sunday, I'll turn 25, and my insurance rates will go down quite a bit, YAY.  there we go, so it's not all bad, but it's enough bad to have me pissed off, which, if you've been reading this long enough, you know can be entertaining in and of itself.

       " 'Well alright party people. I made it til payday :D one thing down, 700 more to go.  I\\'m certainly in a better mood now, still haven\\'t gotten much sleep, but that\\'s OK, it\\'s a holiday weekend! so here\\'s how things have been lately -  did my first deployment to our public webserver, until now I\\'ve mainly worked up internal apps for us, you know, stuff to help us manage our business more effectively. It helps the company to better streamline their workflow. In a slightly more common tongue - my apps have helped us get our work done quicker and easier.  However, I\\'ve finally gotten to put something out to our members only website - in other words, for subscribers only, but still, people other than employees are getting to see some of my work.   Have put out 2 things - 1) a new menu written in Javascript instead of the hairy VBScript one we had that included 12 asp files on every page just to generate the menu (decrease load time substantially I\\'d say) - and 2)  a new mapping page that is totally frickin awesome - and has consumed my worklife every day for about 3 weeks now, with only occasional breaks to maintain other stuff.  its\\' neato , you go to the menu, pick out a client, one of their farms, and one of their fields (from a pop up javascript dialog box, with data generated on the fly) - and then tell it to \"go\" - it then calls a webservice that takes in those inputs, goes and finds all the data we have related to that field - each set of data called a theme - each theme has a legend and a map associated with it - and each field has from 1 - 40 themes.  so my webservice takes the field, finds all the data, and DYNAMICALLY CREATES LEGENDS AND MAPS from it.  frickin cool stuff.  it\\'s not just grabbing predefined images, but actually creating them.  I\\'m creating all the images as PNG\\'s, and that way I can have a variable amount of transparency/opacity for each map image - meaning that when you stack all the differnent theme maps up together, you can actually see through them to the others.  As if that wasnt\\' enough - I also call another webservice from my webservice, to download aerial imagery and topographical maps from  urlLink  TerraServer  which I then scale, trim, and place behind my maps - so you can see that your Ph levels are low, becuase that field has a high spot, or because it runs next to the road and gets a lot of crap dripped down on it when it rains.  The web page also lets you dynamically drag and drop the legends in order to change the way the maps stack - in real time with no posting back to the webserver. - oh, you also choose to turn the themes on and off on the fly as well - you could have all 30 turned on, or nothing, just click a checkbox next to the theme name. I\\'m quite proud :D  the Game dev is going well - the MIA developers have still not shown much oomph. Got one guy kinda back. Hasn\\'t done much but complain so far, so we\\'ll see how much good he does.  Still, even with that kind of setback, we\\'re still kicking ass. CEO decided to slip the date a week.  I think we coulda done it, but I\\'m glad to get to enjoy my holiday weekend.  I think I finished the last major coding section of it tonight - we decided to add it in so that we could include all the skills for each class, and not just a demo-tagged subset. So our users will probably be able to transfer their saves to the new game without much problem, which is a goal I think we should shoot for.  Now that the codebase is done, we can focus on scripting hte plot events. - guess I get to learn python, cause that\\'s what we\\'re using there.  I fixed about 8 scripts earlier, just by reading through some ones we had that I knew worked, doesn\\'t seem horrible, but I\\'d have to have to create them from scratch, as I\\'m still pretty lost on it.

       " 'wow, I haven\\'t posted in a LOOOOONNNGGGGG time.  So, time for an update. The game\\'s final release date was delayed from Oct 31st to Nov 30th. We\\'re accepting preorders starting Nov 7th (3 days away AACK).  Justin, our lead dev and CEO,  has asked me to take over the administrative duties for the project, since he\\'s going to be extremely busy at work for the next 3 weeks.  Poor guy is doing 16 hour days  7 days a week for awhile  - they\\'re trying  to get everything spic and span for some large IEEE convention, so that they can assure themselves funding in the future.  So I\\'m gonna be HELLA busy over the next three weeks. School seems to be going OK, day job is going well, I got a nice raise that I\\'m finally getting to see now - fricking once/month paychecks ;).  Gonna be pretty busy with the day job followed by the game dev. - School program just got finished so now I freed up a bit more time.  Ordered a 20\" trinitron refurb, what I got wasn\\'t a trinitron, and was messed up - colors bled on the edges, text was  fuzzy in the top left corner, gaving me a headache, so I\\'m RMAing it and trying again.  Chris Berry up here at work ordered similarly, and got a nice monitor apparently so I don\\'t feel too bad about it.  the 21\" is nice even with the slightly off display, I love having 3 coding windows up at once, and it makes the virtual desktops in linux that much cooler ;).  Apparently Anil has a friend who\\'d like to buy my old 17\" on the cheap, and I\\'m more than happy to sell it once I get a decent monitor from surpluscomputers.  Speaking of Anil - just a little tip for all the foreign people reading this... Don\\'t take pictures of airplanes in the US.  or near a US armory.  Anil is an amateur photographer (who does great work BTW) and was snapping some shots of some woods around here, not knowing our Armory was behind the trees.  Then he caught a picture of a plane taking off too.  Someone drove by and saw a dark-skinned man taking photographs and called the cops.  This was about a month and a half ago.  last week on Friday his wife was interrogated by the FBI and then yesterday the FBI came back again to interrogate him.  They asked him a lot of questions, they took a CD of the pictures he\\'d taken, and amazingly enough - the asked him if he was a Muslim.  Seems like I remember questioning someone on the basis of religion to be illegal, but maybe it\\'s OK if you\\'re asking them if they\\'re a muslim, since that automatically makes them evil :|.  Anil is Hindi anyways, so he didn\\'t give two craps.  From what I\\'ve noticed he doesn\\'t seem to care for the Muslim\\'s a whole lot anyways ;).  In India the 3 main religions are Hindi, Islam, and Christianity, and apparently they don\\'t mix real well at times.  Anyways, I really wanted to put up something, felt kinda like I was letting the blog slide too long.  So now I\\'ve posted for the few of you who may one day read this in a fit of boredom.  Enjoy.  Phil.',\n",
       " \"After another nice long pause between posts I'm back. So lets recap what's gone on since the last post.  Game went out Dec 1st, and we sold several copies. Lots of bugs to stomp and such, and while I wish the initial release was cleaner, I'm pretty proud at my ability to keep up with the onslaught. We have a really great community of players, and their infinite patience is something I apprecaite.  I really think we filled a void with Devil Whiskey, as that new bard's tale game - once the hope of many - turns out to be a clone of Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, but with a smarmy bard full of 2-bit humor.  Thus Devil Whiskey is really the only outlet for those who want to play the old style CRPGs, but with a new story, better music and graphics.  It's not selling quite as well as I had hoped, but it is selling none-the-less, and I have a sticky feeling that there are a LOT of peopel waiting for a few patches to come out before they'll buy it.  We're also working up some content expansions over the next few weeks, give them some neato stuff to play through, more interesting levels in my book, as they're all self-contained, and arent' being used to further plot - so they can all have nifty interesting stories, riddles, etc.  I'm still continuing to work at SST, and I enjoy it more all the time. Getting into some really fun problems to solve now, a bit more challening. Also, now that I have several apps out there, I'm getting busier with the rest of the business, fixing problems for them, expanding feature-sets and all that.  Good stuff, feel a lot more useful there now.  Finally, the big cool new news - I'm about to buy a home.  My cousin Shawn has a contract to sell a house for someone, and it's a pretty smooth deal.  They need to dump the mortgage ASAP, so it provides us a good oppurtunity to buy it underneath the appraisal value.  We'll end up bagging about 10% equity on the deal, which is great in my mind.  Only thing standing in our way is the lack of a strong account balance for the past few months. Mom and Dad sent me the rest of the cash they were paying me for my back-log of grad-school expenses, and that's plenty to have in the bank for the mortgage company, but it's simply a matter of how long it's been there, they want to see it there for teh last few months. Which it hasnt' been.  I've been tossing out a lot of cash on paying down debt, and Shanna's really only just started working a steady job again, which is the majority of our extra cash, so for about the last month or so, between her earnings, and the game royalties, our financial situation improved ten-fold.  Now getting the house and dealing with the rental lease is my main worry, and will hopefully all be settled soon.\",\n",
       " 'Well, it\\'s been a few MONTHS since I\\'ve said anything...  and what a few months it has. another recap: 1) Not buying a home.. more on that later - I\\'m prety angry that it didn\\'t happen, and yet glad it didn\\'t in a way. 2) SST still going strong, I\\'m a dev lead on a new project that i\\'m really liking. I\\'m enjoying getting out of pure-codemonkey status, and getting into system design in addition to coding. 3) Oh ya - I\\'m divorced now - thus topic 1 :)  So ya, single FyL is back on the scene, mothers lock up your daughters.  Or don\\'t, if they\\'re old enough for me, they probably don\\'t live there anymore anyways, and I\\'m not exactly the \"grab the first 18 year old you see, cause she thinks your cool cause you can buy beer\" type anyways :)  Why\\'d I get a divorce? If you want to know, I\\'ve probably already told you, if not - well sorry, ask me sometime.  When did I get a divorce ? we split up about 5 days after that last post (Jan 10) and were official divorced at some point in February (18th I believe).  So where am I at now?  Same geographical location.  New truck though! yay!  Explorer was about done for, so I traded it in and got myself a 2000 Ford F150, my first Full-Size truck ever.  Used to have an S10 in high school, but it had certainly been awhile, definitely liking a car I can actually fit in comfortably, gotta give thanks for that.  Well, it\\'s late, I\\'m tired, and no one reads this thing but me, and maybe Brian or Kaleb.  Hi guys if you\\'re there. If you\\'re not, I hate you suck.  or something. I dunno  Anyways, I hope this message finds everyone happy, healthy, and a bit wiser from the days experiences.  If you know any hot chicks who would like to date a total dork like me, please feel free to send em my way. I\\'m both a scholar and a gentleman.  Phil.',\n",
       " \"I'm trying to keep up with my typical post-once-every-three months schedule - so far I'm right on track ;)    Well, lets see - what all neato new things are going on in my life.  As per usual - the small stuff first:       Finished with Devil Whiskey - it was mucho fun, and I really enjoyed my time there - but the contract has been completed, and I just really don't have enough time to continue on there. The game is still selling well, and the europeans are pouncing on it whenever a magazine article comes out in their country.     Still at SST - still kicking ass there - things are getting tight - we have a seasonal release schedule (being ag based) so this time of year finds us pushing to get all the new stuff done to be ready for fall planning.     Almost done with the Shanna payments - ready for that to be over and done - close that chapter of my life. Got back the Honda she had - she never arranged for new financing so I have to sell it to pay off the lien - there was some mechanical stuff wrong with it that needs fixing first so I'm gonna be trying hard to break even on the deal. Honda's have great resell value, but tossing 60k miles on car in a year will hurt you no matter what kind of car it is.    So that's all the typical here's my life right now news and then the biggie (like you probably don't know or can't guess):    I've met an amazing girl     Her name is Jennifer, she lives here in Stillwater. She's about to finish her M.S. in Psychology, and will be pursuing her PhD shortly thereafter. Very intelligent, kind, and interesting woman. She rocks my frickin socks off and that's that. If you need to know more, you can probably find me easily enough otherwise, I'll catch up with ya later in another three months when I'm halfway through next semester's courses (which will suck).      Anyways, that's enough info for now, see ya soon.\",\n",
       " \"The advertising agency I work for is housed in a hundred year old textile mill. The mill was reclaimed years ago and refashioned into a business incubator, which is exactly what its name implies; most of the businesses here are young, cash poor and hungry. They are all courting venture capital, or awaiting that magical relationship with Microsoft or General Motors that will make all five employees rich beyond the dreams of avarice and send them to tan on a golden beach somewhere. But these dreams for almost all of us are just that -- dreams. We stay affloat and do our best to keep moving ahead. We take good fortune in the little trickles it chooses to show itself in, and we hope that the next day will find the phone full of voicemails with work offers. In my boss's mind, we've made it. The yard stick by which she measures out success is the two full time employees and one cash-cow account we have to our claim. That second full time employee is a new hire, and his recent arrival has meant a smorgasbord of vacation time for that same boss. Our apparent competence, coupled with her restlessness, has meant a lot of screw ups and tense moments over the last ten weeks. Unnanounced days off. Lengthy mornings off. This has also thrust one tired twenty-five year old, on more than one occasion, into the flight seat of an advertising agency overseeing one hundred and fifteen thousand dollars worth of ad dollars per month. And he is me. And he is leaving.  When I was very small my sister lived in Washington, DC. We would go visit her frequently and stay in her craftsman style house in Chevy Chase, MD with her roomates whose names and faces time has seen fit to erase from my memory. What was never erased, though, was the feeling of being in DC -- the feeling that there was a whole world out there beyong the sloped front yard and cramped confines of my parents suburban home. When she moved back to our home town, it would be years before I would go back. A short trip with my dad and brother rekindled the flame. After that I spent several weekends there, drinking it in in huge gulps and taking ten dozen cameras full of pictures. It was around the time that my ex and I started hanging out with the hellyeah kids that I decided it would be the perfect place to live full time. She and I never talked with any certainty about doing it. It was always more of a fantasy we'd engage in, or something we'd talk about when the rent was late and we wished to be anywhere but the small town we lived in.  But now, as both my experience and my duties have begun to pile up (and my level of frustration at the lack of any sort of structure here) I am really leaving. And I didn't even know it until I met S.  I'm not inclined to be very sentimental, or put much stock in odd coincidences. But within the first twenty minutes I knew S, we mentioned DC. Not as some vacation spot or a nice place to get sushi, but as a  destination . Her talk of moving as we got to know each other became a constant. It pushed me to look inside and ask myself why I had dragged my feet so long about moving. When I realized I might be falling for her, I ran out of reasons. So here I am looking through job listings she's printed for me, or talking to someone who knows someone who might get me work. And the pieces are all clicking, Loudly. This is really happening.\",\n",

       " \"I just came back to this after a few months of forgetting it was even here. I've been working so hard on my own content management system that I just forgot to do things like update this. Or sleep. Or eat things that weren't in cardboard pouches. I guess I've forgotten a lot of things, many of which were of extreme paramount importance. Others I'm okay with. So, I think I'll use this as a photolog when I get my  urlLink new camera . Or should I get the  urlLink guitar  first?\",\n",
       " \"S is upstairs. Right now. Asleep in my bed. I am here, in the living room. Updating this thing. This is because, as far as she knows, I'm not sleepy. This is only partly true. The actual truth is closer to my own increasing confusion about exactly what is happening between us.  Here's what happens. We hold. We touch. Anything beyond that seems tolerated, but not exactly enjoyed. Perhaps that's a bit harsh. But it's the way I feel. I can't say anything, though. I'm sure if I did it would be sort of a problem. So I just do the best I can with what I have. Which, granted, is a lot. I mean, should my own inability to understand the finer points of asexual platonic sleeping be grounds to doubt any possibility of this relationship mutating into something else? Probably not. And yet, I find myself feeling a little frustrated with things every now and again.  This is wrong, I know. This is selfish and stupid and childish. Still, I can't beat back the feeling. It's there sometimes. Part of me wants to kiss her. But I stop there. I think after several years of upheaval in terms of my sexual role with L I'm ready to set it down for a while. But still it's nice to feel attractive, and not just like an object of comfort or protection or a guard against loneliness. Too harsh again, perhaps. But I still can't help it.  Tonight we happened upon a rock show in a very unique venue downtown. In an ancient junk shop there is a stage and a PA, and some friends of friends are playing music. S and I go at the behest of a figure from her not too distant past. So I ended up making a new friend and seeing a band I had wanted to see for some time. The seats in the place are old couches and livingroom chairs from the Eisenhower administration. Midway through the second bands set, S slides her foot underneath my knee. I wanted to let it kill me, but it didn't faze me at all. That's sad because I want to be attracted to her and have it reciprocated, and I want to have that secret feeling in the pit of my stomach that signals nervousness and desire. Maybe I outgrew it? Maybe it feels pointless?  Maybe I'm jumping the gun on all this. Maybe these things will come with time. Who knows. I want to see where it goes, because I value S -- her opinions and her time. I am jumping the gun right?\",\n",
       " 'I was so exhausted yesterday after another night of drifting in and out in S\\'s bed. I don\\'t know what it is about it, but so often I just can\\'t sleep there. I still think it\\'s a function of being too warm.  I snuck out for a nap during lunchtime, and felt much better when I got back to work. I drove to a client\\'s and did a short pitch for a website that went very well, and I think my budget will go through with little or no changes. After work, I came home and almost immediately launched into a workout. I tried a few new exercises -- I can really feel the weighted side bends today -- and wasted an hour or so playing guitar and messing with Garageband. I had left S a message, wondering after her job status. Sometime later she called and asked if I\\'d like company. I did, of course, want company.  I should tell you that I am very self-concious about my apartment. I\\'m not messy, but I just don\\'t own much stuff. I\\'ve spent the first few years of independant life amassing all the techie goodies and musical toys I always wanted, and haven\\'t really worried much about furniture. I do have nice table settings though. This would mark only the third time S had been into the house -- and only the second time that the visit would last more than a minute or two. I gave her a very brief tour the first time, and the second time we were confined mainly to the living room watching The Office on DVD.  On the phone she asked what would happen were she to be rendered too exhausted to drive home? I replied something faux-witty about having something called a bed.   I spent most of the evening trying to keep my distance, since I\\'d managed to make it all evening without a post-workout shower. I brought her my Powerbook so that she could check her email, and she proceeded to raid my home directory and go through my photo archives. At one point, with just the tiniest note of emotion in her voice, she said to something along the lines of, \"you really loved her...\" She meant L, my ex and former live-in. I replied that I did, but that my romantic love for L left, along with my couch, long ago. S seemed encouraged by what she deemed my \"capacity for love.\" She lamented the fact that so many people seem to not have such a thing. I only wish she knew the half of it. I fall in love so easily it\\'s ridiculous.  After a shower for me, it was time for bed. Not awkward. Not weird. Just bed. S seemed to feel as though I was anticipating something. I genuinely wasn\\'t, and was only looking forward to a decent nights sleep and maybe an arm around me. After popping a melatonin I drifted off and slept through the night without incident. Obviously, even if I wanted to, I couldn\\'t remember the exact timeline of the evening after climbing into bed. Some things stay, though. The last emotion I remember having very clearly was the slightest twinge of something. It wasn\\'t anger. It was just a need for some explanation of exactly what it was we were doing. It passed wordlessly. Drifting off, S said to me,  \"You like rules.\" I smiled, made a puzzled expression for the benefit of the darkness and the nape of her neck. \"No I don\\'t,\" I chuckled. \"No?\" \"No. I have a rule: no rules.\"  She\\'s playing at not wanting to put things in boxes again. I\\'m already asleep.',\n",
       " \"S started a blog of her own. She really is quite a writer. She also saw my blog, which has provided hours of awkward exchanges. Fun. So, since no one but me and people who might stumble upon it even know it's here, I'm going to start using this blog to say all those secret things that dare not speak their names in more polite circles.   S and I are both bound for Washington, DC someday. As she often reminds me, she will probably be there long before me. Though I don't want to believe this, I have to accept it; I just signed off on a salaried position that I can't very well just walk away from mere weeks after taking it. There are also the niggling money woes that still dog me, and my lame car. All the rest, like my debilitating fear of certain kinds of travel inherited from certain members of my family, are no longer issues. And the recent application (and likely acceptance to) a job in the greater DC area will likely give S a dramatic head start towards northern Virginia.  The time we spend together lately is blissfully strange, and more often than not I wake up in her room with squares and triangles of sunlight recreating the works of Kandinski on the wall behind the head of the bed. Sometimes I know I'm a warm body; other times I could swear there's something more than some intricate and bizarre friendship at play. I woke up several nights ago and rolled over away from her, only to have her call me back and throw her arm around me. It's sad to be 25 years old and experience that and have the momentary feeling that you could finally die happy. But that's the hand that my life has dealt me, so I can't beat myself up about it. Last time I was there, she was worried about the mess she had got herself into, chartering last minute flights to attend a round of job interviews. I crossed a line I had sworn to myself I would not cross. I put my hands through her hair and -- rather easily -- began to try and comfort her. She made mention of the fact that it was working, and it felt wonderful. But there is still that underlying strangeness. The good news is that as time goes the relationship gets to be less and less strange and more solid and substantial.  In the background of all this I am trying not to notice my clothes getting a bit looser, and my face developing something that other humans call a  chin . Who knew. Once again, after a period that found me deriding him, I owe a great debt to Henry Rollins once again. And to my brothers W and A. I'm sure one knows it, and reasonably certain the other would never cop to it due to his unerring humility.\",\n",
       " \"Today, Augusten Burroughs is checking into rehab, the printer is having a meltdown with my art files, and I am looking for a new couch. I have also broken a long-standing date to go to the zoo and meet someone from YP that I had talked to earlier this Spring. I simply could not make myself go. I mean the print shop actually did have a meltdown, so I would have been late anyway. I just wasn't feeling any enthusiasm about it. Something tells me this is a little weird, because it was seeming like a lot of fun until this morning. I'm not going to bother reading in to all this. It wasn't even a date. It just felt...wrong? Wrongish, anyway, if not totally objectionable. I'm also still trying to figure out the phone call last night. I am failing at coming up with any solid theories. All I know is that I was upset that my friend was upset, and I felt myself wishing I could make it a little easier. Of course none of these things are required of me, so I felt a little silly. Finding my place in all this is a very engaging and enjoyable past time. It's the perfect thing to think about while you pick out sofas. So, here I go to do just that.\",\n",
       " 'I have been battling exhaustion for a few days now. I\\'m not sleeping well, and I\\'m tired of thinking I\\'m out of the woods financially only to have something new come up. I\\'ve tried really hard to get motivated about lifting, but it\\'s proving to be very difficult; I start working and I fall asleep between sets on the bench. This really isn\\'t helpful. I think all of this is pointing to a change of venue. I spoke to the owner of a company that offered me a job. I ultimately turned it down in favor of the newly-salaried job I currently have, but he could tell I was apprehensive about letting it go. I told him about my desire to move to the DC area, and he brightened up. He basically told me to name my field and he can find work for me. I told him money was an issue, and that I wouldn\\'t take a pay cut. He was unfazed. So it looks as though the employment scene there might not be as tough to crack as I thought. He told me not to worry about degrees or credentials because, as he said, \"your portfolio speaks for itself.\" I haven\\'t told a soul any of this yet, but it makes me feel incredible to think that I might actually be able to network my way up to DC before I\\'m 26. It also doesn\\'t hurt that I could be making $50k when I do it. Fuck, that looks snotty to read. But can I help it that I want to be comfortable and not struggle anymore? So today, while I try to make something out of the nothing that is the days job orders, I\\'m looking at Craig\\'s List for places to rent. One of my other difficulties when moving will be trying to deal with my lousy credit, which has a way of making it difficult to rent anywhere. I\\'ve resigned myself to a bad credit score for some time, even though I am well on my way to crawling out from under the vast majority of the debt that I accrued when I was younger. Still, sharing a place with a room mate may not prove to be too weird, and I\\'ll probably be spending the first year in the new place just finding my way around and having all kinds of crazy fun, merely using my apartment to sleep and nothing else. There\\'s WiFi all over DC, so I could even work in restaurants and bars if I have to. I\\'m just prepared to  go ; I don\\'t want to over think it and bellyache about where I\\'ll stay or money or transportation. Of course I want somewhere to live and some way to get around. But I\\'m inspired by the ways my friends have found to set their sites on a new town and just pick up and go -- especially Reuben, who always manages to fly slightly by the seat of his pants and have fun doing it. I think if dreaming about something almost daily without any resolution (other than two day visits) for five years doesn\\'t kill your desire for it, then it\\'s meant to be. So this is the year to do it. S says this is my test. If I am to be tested then now\\'s the time, because I\\'m finally ready.',\n",
       " \"S left on her trip today, but not before calling me on my office doorway weirdness. Fuck. I don't know why I get the way I do. It's ridiculous I know. I just start feeling so...polite? Respectful? I dunno. It's weird. So yes, When Harry Met Sally has nothing on the weirdness that is this. Then, as I reviewed the playlist I made her for her trip for the eight-millionth time, I realized some of the lyrics are sort of innappropriate. Maybe that isn't the right word. I just don't want anyone getting any ideas. Unfortunately pop music really hasn't found a way to write a song about whatever this is so you sort of have to find what you can and make it fit. That's why it's so advantageous to be able to put twelve or so tracks on one CD; I can take something from here and something from there and make it all cohesive. Sort of. Plus it's just nice to give your friends good music to listen to on long trips, car or otherwise.  I hope I am not the only one who can see the ironic value in that Daft Punk song.

       " 'Sometimes I know exactly what Pete Townsend was talking about, when all the confusion of feelings and friends and the past and the inevitable future are all in your midst.   Last night was pure summer 2003. D (my boss and one of my closest friends) had some of us over to grill out in the rain. We had fun, had lots of drinks. A good meal was had as well. As I was bedding down on the couch (which was exactly where I needed to be, I admit) S called. We embarked on a pretty lengthy conversation, that included her reading passages from a book on Feng Shui. What most people know about this subject would fill a thimble, and is usually limited to the correct way to point your bed. Apparently there\\'s more to it than this, going so far as to include notions that we might associate more strongly with Western psychotherapy.  Feng Shui can even tell you where to put your baggage. Or at least how best to prepare it for travel. Without you. Into the garbage.  I moved into this house with someone else. It was  our  house. I hate it here now. It\\'s not like home at all; it\\'s more like a place to store things until something better comes along. I don\\'t hate it because I miss her, or lament our failed relationship. I hate it here because it still contains a lot of things that she left me to clean up and do away with. In doing that she left me the emotional baggage of two people to sort through and make final decisions about. I have only realized this recently and it\\'s taking me a little time to arrive at the inevitable conclusion that if she left it she doesn\\'t want it, and it goes. I know resentment can eat you alive, and it isn\\'t attractive. The same goes for bitterness. Part of me bristles at the thought of unpacking all this and throwing it away, only to have to repack all my things in a few months and move.  Last night S tells me, seemingly apropos of nothing but I was kind of tipsy, that she isn\\'t waiting anymore. It didn\\'t worry me then, but as today ages into its afternoon it\\'s starting to make me ponder a bit.  S also enlightened me as to her own personal theories about some facets of my personality, and I have to say some of them were not so dead on. I told D this morning about being a day to day person, and that S was right in assuming that leaving high school to go build websites has rendered me someone with loads of experience but no papers. Against her better judgement, D said, she told me how I needn\\'t worry about finding work elsewhere; that it would happen, and that I should be glad that college hadn\\'t \"beaten the artist out of\" me. She also joked that she might even write a letter of recommendation for me. D is worried about my leaving, and she knows it will happen a lot sooner than she wants it to, or -- shamefully -- a lot sooner than I\\'ve let on. And it gets shorter everyday. In the last six months, I have changed more than I have in the previous nine years. I am strong, and happy, and finacially secure. These changes are for me, and were made by me. These are the changes that will facilitate my moving and starting a new life, one where the internal changes can mingle happily with the external ones.  That\\'s the top secret plan. The one I never mention. I will move. I will make good money. I will come into my own and I will be living in  my  city -- not my familys --  mine . I think all sets of positive changes are precipitated by a walkabout. Yes baggage follows you -- but if you\\'re in a new town where it doesn\\'t know the streets or the buildings then maybe you can lose it, or make it scared and small enough to put in your pocket. And best of all I will be doing this in less than a year. Saying makes it feel better, and makes it real. But there are topics I haven\\'t breached yet. They\\'ll have to wait.',\n",

Today I've been trying to actively get past it with only limited success; I had a healthy breakfast and lifted weights first thing this morning. I was early to the first appointment of the day. I even worked dutifully from home when the office got unbearable. But I'm still sort of touchy and liable to take things the wrong way, and I generally feel kind of mopey. All last night I had horrible nightmares that jerked me awake several times. I kept waking up and watching S sleep peacefully, and finding things to worry about.  And it feels so horrible and awful. I haven't had a mood in five months, so I am totally unprepared to accept it. That's why I'm fighting it so hard, because I just want it  gone . It's just inopportune and unwelcome and I wish it wouldn't happen.  I keep wondering if I jinxed myself by putting too much stock into what she wrote on her blog about potential for a flame out. But I'm not flaming out about that, or anything in particular really. I just feel listless, and unable on some level to let my vacation slip into the rear view and get back to work. I haven't really said how amazing and relaxing all that was yet. It's worth mentioning how fantastic it was to be there with one of my best friends, not to mention S.  We had a moment on the beach that I think I will remember for the rest of my life, even if all this ends tomorrow. There were several other moments that will linger in my memory for a very long time, regardless of anything else that happens. I keep trying to think on those things, and all my other good fortune, to try and shake this -- but again with limited success.   So right now I'm off on a bike ride in hopes that a little more exercise will help the situation, since it has helped the most of all the things I've tried. A refill of Lamictal might help too. So, here goes nothing.\",\n",
       " 'To hear my father tell it, the face of the American South changed drastically with the advent of air conditioning -- and I don\\'t doubt it for one minute. I try to picture movie theatres that are full nearly around the clock, and lunch counters peopled by the sweaty masses nursing ice waters. This is the south of my dad\\'s generation. Now the subtle clunk of AC compressors starting up is the soundtrack of daily life here in offices and homes. The heat finally killed the AC in our office this week though, so we\\'re suffering and so is our attendance. The heat is almost a living thing, like a fourth employee who won\\'t shut up and drinks all the coffee before you can have one single cup.  So it\\'s a pleasure to have lunch with S and talk about the minutiae of our days, or swap family histories. Yesterday we rearranged our schedules and skipped lunch just so -- as she puts it -- I could watch her nap in my bed for twenty minutes. Yes, maybe that\\'s a little funny. But all I know is that I have the inclination to do that sort of thing with her, but none of the \"craziness\" that has gone with it before; it just feels very normal and natural. I think the craziness we fear could also be called codepedance, depending on how up you are on psychology lingo. I think we could make a great team of some kind. Her ideas lately about selling my art have made me hopeful for a future where I can pursue fine art again, and flattered at her appreciation for my photography. But I also still marvel at our ability to live independant lives, and spend time apart if for no other reason than we want to. The relationship I am coming out of was all about codependance; we were rarely seperated and when we were it was out of necessity. We both hated it, but were powerless to stop. My greatest fear in any relationship is that I may lapse into it again, and I am greatly encouraged by knowing that it would have reared its head by now and it hasn\\'t. I think there\\'s definitely something here, and I\\'m trying to get over the superstition I have about talking about it. So I\\'m off to my favorite coffee shop to try and get some  urlLink work  done. Remind me to write a letter to GE for inventing this life changing thing called air conditioning.',\n",
       " 'In polite conversation in the south, they call it \\'the procedure.\\'   I think they probably call it that everywhere actually, unless you\\'re discussing politics. Then it\\'s okay to use the word \\'abortion\\', since the word carries enough weight to almost be a political statement unto itself.  Anyway, that experience is a large part of why I got upset the other night when I undertook to clear out the first of several rooms in my house of my previous life. And in talking to my \\'paid friend\\' today -- who is amazed at my progress, my forward momentum, my excitement at each new day -- she mentioned how easy it is for people to mistake your mourning for lost time or your bidding farewell to your previous self as mourning for something else. The fact is that I am so far removed from wanting to go back and change things that the thought never even occurs to me; I just look past all the junk and put the time and the person out of my head. The PF says this is common for males too. We are largely the \"out of site, out of mind\" sort, who tend to not notice when it comes to the leavings of an absent former partner. \"You may not notice when it\\'s there, but you sure as hell will notice when it\\'s not,\" she said, meaning the feeling of liberation is empowering. And I know it is after driving all those years of being a sucker and not caring about myself or my own feelings directly to the dumpster and tossing them in.  I also told her about my move, which gave her a huge smile and a speechless moment, considering I barely wanted to leave the house a year ago when I started therapy.  She seemed to think it was funny, though not altogether out of character, for me to stop drinking completely until I learn to call cabs. But whatever works.  On my monitor at work, there are two Chinese cookie fortunes. One says  \"There is a prospect of a thrilling time ahead for you.\"  The other says  \"Soon you will be sitting on top of the world.\"  Chinese cookie fortunes are my only superstition, so I  have  to believe them, right?',\n",
       " \"What's an hour of your new healthy life spent divesting yourself of your old unhappy one? It's an hour well spent.  The physical manifestation of my emotional clutter goes out with tomorrow's garbage. If I'm through there's no point in keeping any of this. It's as if L wants this -- to try and have the last word. Well, the move is the end of the conversation. And what I'm spending tonight completing is the start of shutting my mouth. I tried to clean earlier tonight, and I gutted my office of old furniture and crap I didn't want to move later in the year. But my effort was incomplete. The effort I made didn't match my new life, or my true emotional state. I was hanging onto things out of habit. It all has to go. I will sleep in my own house tonight. Mine.  So I actively sought them out tonight. In drawers. In piles of mail. Dressers. None of them mean anything. I was a victim in this whole thing. The days of feeling responsible for two people's baggage are over. None of the other things are even worth my effort to put on eBay. They go out to the trash as well as soon as I post this. I'm thinking about hurling out a lot of family baggage, too. I hang onto too much. None of if reflects me anymore anyhow.  And as stupid as it sounds, I need S to know that I'm earnest about my feelings. I like her company on this adventure far too much to risk it.   And I'll tell you, after you find the first thing hiding out somewhere and toss it away you feel like a million fucking bucks. And the sleep of the righteous and freed is your reward. I learned this tonight, this late in the game. It's amazing how many things in life you assume will hurt, and feel like flying when you actually do them.\",\n",
       " \"Wow. WiFi in the middle of downtown Greensboro. How cool is that? As long as I pick a spot within the shadow of a building I'm not too hot, and the reception seems as if it's pretty good all over the block. I wonder if it leaks into the Cultural Center enough to make it usable while I have some crab dip and a beer @ Europa? I just have to remind myself that for the one measly hotspot we have in Greensboro, there are probably eight million in DC.   Speaking of the whole DC plan, S and I have been having the time of our lives lately. After making it through ther turmoil of the last couple of weeks, and my best attempts to subconciously fuck it all up, we are both being graciously rewarded. I can't even begin to tell you how excited I am to be taking these first few steps with someone like her. I feel as though I found a vein of serenity running through all the fast-paced goings on lately. Yes, Virginia, there is a girl who's smart, hot and hilarious. And she happens to like spending time with me.  Alright, it's getting warm out here and the car fumes are starting to make me feel woozy. But it was fun while it lasted. Off to spend an hour or two with my brother.\",\n",

       " 'Let\\'s just say I hardly expected to be talking about religion (not matter how indirectly) on my second entry, but such is the world we live in. To set the stage, I\\'d like to entertain you with a little anecdote:  So the greatest guy in the world - for ambiguity\\'s sake, let\\'s call him \"Adrian\" - is playing Counter-Strike online one Victoria Day afternoon when a certain individual - who, for ambiguity\\'s sake, we will call \"Priscilla\" - hiding behind the anonymity of the Internet, signs onto the server Adrian is playing in and changes his screenname to \"i fight for allah\". Adrian, being such a smart guy, corrects Priscilla, saying Allah is, in fact, spelt with a capital \\'A\\'. To which Priscilla responds, \"allah is not my god, so i choose not to capitalize it.\" Adrian is struck upside the head by this comment, and as a result, ceases to refer to himself in the third-person.  Yes, folks, believe it or not, \"Allah\" is a proper noun, and as such should be spelt with a capital \\'A\\'. Priscilla\\'s comment is the equivalent of saying \"George Bush isn\\'t my president, so I\\'m not going to capitalize his name\" or \"I don\\'t drive a Ford, so from now on it will be known as \\'mustang\\'\".   Even so, the word \"Allah\" isn\\'t specific to Islam; it\\'s the Arabic word for \"God\". Even Arabic Christians and Jews call God \"Allah\". So, unless Priscilla does not believe in any higher being, Allah  is  technically Priscilla\\'s god.  Ah, but what can one do? Much to my chagrin, I can\\'t spend more than thirty seconds online without coming across this sort of garbage. As a result, I try not to talk much while playing Counter-Strike.  So what does our petulant protagonist do? He proceeds to make Priscilla eat hot lead, four rounds straight. Doesn\\'t that make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside?  The End.',\n",
       " \"Yes, this is it. Much to the delight of all connected to the Internet, if not the world, I have decided to start my very own online blog. There shall be rejoicing in the streets! Drinks are on me.  Sarcasm aside, I feel this will be an interesting experience. It's hard to pinpoint my reasons for choosing to publishing my deepest, most personal thoughts only for the world to see. The man living in my right auditory canal, but we'll leave that subject alone for the time being. No, let's focus on a couple succinct, less personal reasons:  1) Being a self-professed geek and technophile, I figure I should have some semblance of a web site, lest my PDA reject my body and eat its way through my pocket, thereby ruining a perfectly good pair of pants. In my history online, I have started exactly three personal web sites, and have finished exactly zero. Let us pray this one will live long enough to catch interest in online communities, making yours truly an Internet sensation overnight. One can dream.  2) A few of my good friends, both online and in that frightening void know as the Real World, have similar online journals. I have yet to come across a trend more worthy of my endorsement.  3) My mind is a raging sea of useless knowledge and half-finished thoughts. Hear that gurgling sound? Could just be the three-day-old leftover Kentucky Fried Chicken using my stomach as a medium to communicate with the living world, but let's not go there. Anyway, I feel I should have a place to write down some of the things that spew forth from my cerebral cortex on an hourly basis.  4) Being at the height of my teenage years, I feel it may be time to indulge in a little navel-gazing and soul-searching. Therefore, during the lifespan of this blog, I will successfully deduce no less than the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything. You can take my word for it.  Having seen this, I'm guessing that this blog will end up being some odd combination of  urlLink Slashdot  and  The Catcher in the Rye . Nevertheless, a good time will be had by all. I hope I will be able to find the time to stop by and update regularly.  I can see that nearly an hour has passed since I started this composition.

Hopefully once exams are over in a couple of weeks I\\'ll be able to get on here more frequently. In the meantime, let\\'s go over the past week, in insufferable detail, replete with witty idioms and colloquialisms! I\\'m quivering just thinking about it!   Wednesday:  Uh, Wednesday. Wednesday... Hmmmm. Must not have been an overly interesting day if I can\\'t remember a thing about it. According to my PDA, I had a math test and the last day of my Accounting summative, but I\\'ll be damned if I can remember. I  do  know my team managed to blow the two-goal lead we had going into the second half. End result: 2-2. No, I didn\\'t score, but at least I didn\\'t have to rip a loose flap of skin off my heel again. Moving on...   Thursday:  Thursday was quite an eventful day, comparatively. My mom finally dragged me across town to the licencing center to get my G1 (\"learner\\'s permit\", to all the less enlightened out there). Some forms, an eye test, and 40 multiple-choice questions later, and I can now drive! I\\'m free as a bird! A bird who has to fly with 0.0% blood-alcohol level, an adult with at least four-years flying experience in the passenger seat, an only between one half-hour before sunrise to one half-hour after sunset. But I digress.  It\\'s not that I don\\'t  want  to drive. It\\'s just that I have no  motivation  to start. I\\'m not going to have my own car, or have regular access to one, and as soon as I pass my road test, I\\'ll be relegated to the position of \"taxi driver\" for my little sister. Add $600 for driver\\'s ed. and the early onset of grey hair thanks to having to drive with my dad, and the whole thing just didn\\'t seem worth it. Ah, well, things are now in motion.  After working at the library from 3:30-5:30, I got  the  best exercise I\\'ve had in months. Certainly felt like it anyway. It seems the Powers That Be decided to have me referee a 14-year-old boys\\' game way up at Notre Dame High School in north Burlington. Of course, my dad is out of town, and my mom has to work, leaving me stuck with a bicycle as my only means of transportation to said game. Of course, the route I have to take it  uphill , into a headwind, for about 2km. Needless to say, I was puttering along on my grannie gear for most of the trip. Truth be told, though, I\\'m not in the best shape. On the other hand, coming home was a blast: I\\'m sure I hit a good 50 clicks going downhill.   Friday:  Friday, hmmmm... Friday. A lot like Wednesday. Got my math test back (aced it), did a Cisco practical exam (aced it), had to work at the soccer club from 6-9. That\\'s just about it.   Saturday:  Six hour shifts at the soccer club are  not  fun. Especially now that the season has started and there\\'s really nothing to do but surf the Internet, random odd job exclusive. So after working 9-3 I came home and... slept? Did homework? Played  Morrowind  for four hours? Your guess is as good as mine. This is why I need to update more often.   Sunday:  Sunday morning I got up and no one was home. It was a nice day, so I went for a walk... and bought a new  urlLink mouse . It was on sale, what can I say? This is why I shouldn\\'t go for walks very often: I always end up buying something. I highly recommend the mouse, by the way.   Monday:  Let\\'s run through this quickly - My Computer Engineering class managed to talk my teacher into letting us write our summative test on Wednesday instead. I say to them, why bother? You\\'re not going to be ready then, either.  - Learned about alkenes in Chemistry. Whee!  - Hung around in Physics class longer than I had to. Double whee!  - Worked at the library 6-9  - Came home and watched the Flames lose the Stanley Cup. While studying for a Cisco exam. Right, \"studying\".   Tuesday:  That\\'s today, so hopefully I\\'ll be able to remember  something . Wrote my Cisco exam, and got 85%. Pretty good, considering it was on chapters 1-14, and we\\'ve only covered 1-8. During lunch I crammed for the Computer Science summative test I had to write last period. After getting out of Accounting early, I went down to the cafeteria to pick up my yearbook, sign a couple others, and participate in some rousing games of euchre. Math class consisted of more yearbooks signing. What do you expect for the second-last day of school? Anyway, the Comp. Sci. test was a breeze, so I was able to go home a bit early.  Which brings us to the here and now. Wasn\\'t that fun?   Now, I must go suffer through another three hours at the soccer club. Ciao!',\n",

When his \\'Ninth Hour,\\' a wax effigy of Pope John Paul II felled by a meteorite, went on view at a museum in Warsaw in 2001, two men damaged the work by trying to put the figure on its feet.  The new work was sponsored by a private art foundation and produced immediate debate in Italian newspapers and, after its destruction, at the tree itself, where a seemingly permanent crowd of people gathered.  This vandalism echoed a case in Sweden early this year. While attending an opening at a museum in Stockholm in January, Zvi Mazel, Israel\\'s ambassador to Sweden, damaged an artwork that he felt glorified Palestinian suicide bombers. The work was created by Dror Feiler, an expatriate Israeli artist living in Sweden, and his Swedish wife, Gunilla Skold Feiler. News accounts said it consisted of a large basin of red fluid on which a small boat floated with a photograph of a smiling woman, Hanadi Jaradat, a suicide bomber who killed 21 people in Haifa last Oct. 4. The ambassador\\'s action was commended by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who told his cabinet that he had called Mr. Mazel and told him \\'that the government stands behind him on this issue.\\'  Impulsive destruction that is sanctioned by a nation\\'s leaders is different from the work of an inebriated, possibly celebrity-seeking individual like Mr. de Benetetto. But both acts seem motivated by a one-dimensional reaction and a  distorted sense of entitlement that is especially surprising in the case of Mr. Mazel, a professional diplomat . Most surprising is attackers\\' simple refusal to entertain paradox, to see art as a coalescence of gray areas, ambiguities and multiple interpretations. Art\\'s job is to provoke thought in ways that are difficult to resolve and uncomfortable; it\\'s a relatively neutral place to experience the unresolvable issues that dominate real life, to practice a kind of abstract flexibility that might move us toward resolution in real life.\"',\n",

       " u'Proofread and annotated. [Annotations are in brackets.]   30 June 2004  Culture is an elusive concept. It transcends all - race, location, and numerous other barriers. It\\u2019s pervasive, yet invisible; you make it seem almost like some hidden enemy or danger, lurking everywhere and everpresent, a constant threat. But what is culture?  What is culture? The collective consciousness of a people: the value, traditions, history, and perspective of a community - in the nebulous sense of the word - and the underlying reasoning for the above. The \\u201cwhy\\u201d of culture is important - possibly of more value than merely the descriptors of the culture. [I have no idea how I jumped from defining culture to some crap about \\u201cwhy\\u201d. However, why culture exists is probably pretty significant.] It is the foundation that has determined the current state of a culture today and where it will go - or where it can go. [Cultures are not in stasis, they revolve around change, or an aversion to it. Change is never always good, nor ever always bad. But one thing it is always - it happens, and there\\u2019s little you can do to stop it.] One must realise that change is something human beings are highly adverse to and it requires an often-intimate understanding of not only the position taken by an opposing culture but the experiences which have acted in conjunction to mould those positions. Who was it that said something about it being easier to condemn than understand?  Cultures are like diamonds: they\\u2019re valuable, multi-faceted, and seemingly illuminated by an inner radiance. But neither necessarily shines in their own right - they take input and meld it - transform it - into something brilliant. But unlike diamonds, there are innumerable cultures and co-cultures - every one of us is party to countless cultures at any given time. Also, diamonds are forever; cultures are not. Everyone joins and leaves given cultures on a whim or maybe out of some requirement or need.  [A perfect example of a transient culture is Governor\\u2019s School. Sure, we\\u2019re all here by choice, but we can\\u2019t leave the culture once we\\u2019ve joined. And in retrospect, the dynamic does change greatly over time. Time here is compressed, so the changes are even more noticeable. From the first, rather awkward, day to now, when we\\u2019re all more settled-in, one can see our society being changed - and changing - its members.]  Being placed in a foreign culture is interesting. Particularly is the culture is pronouncedly different than one\\u2019s own. [But isn\\u2019t every culture very different in some aspect than one\\u2019s own?] One feels lost at best, maybe even a bit intoxicated by the assault of strange and unusual stimuli. When I was visiting China in the summer of 2000, I was placed in exactly that position. But I\\u2019m Chinese, I said; and, I speak - if nothing more - fluent Chinese! How is it possible one can speak effortlessly to the populous yet remain a total foreigner, that one needs more than just words to relate? But we do; because culture isn\\u2019t confined to merely utterances of the mouth, it is expressed in the clothes one wears, the attitude one holds, the forms of interaction that occur which go beyond speech to encompass such aspects of communication as body language. But there I was, forlorn and confined, shunned as a waiguoren - an \\u201coutsider\\u201d. It sucked, knowing that I was essentially paying my way through life with greenbacks. Traveling to Qu\\xe9bec was fun too; and I felt more at home there than in even the most Western parts of Beijing or Hong Kong. American money is just as useful in either place.  Yes there were stumblings in my attempts at \\u201clearning the culture\\u201d, but I thoroughly enjoyed both experiences. A wise friend one said that, \\u201cEven if you stumble, you\\u2019ve still made progress. And who can argue against progress?\\u201d [And another wise saying that went something like \\u201cIt is only by being torn out of that which is comfortable to you, being forced to look at your life from a distance, that you see yourself.\\u201d]   2 July 2004  There used to be a class entitled \\u201cThe Theory of Knowledge\\u201d that was offered at my school. Probably they had the whole ontology-epistemology, subjective-objective-intersubjective thing going. It must have been a wondrous class though, being able to spend an hour every day discussing what is, what out to be, why it is - or ought to be, and the underlying principles of that knowledge.  What does lying count as[, in this realm of thought]? I mean, if one believes strongly enough, [some lies can be as good as the truth.] And if enough people [believe in this collective lie]?   And thus religion was born. Just kidding\\u2026  But I see how the methods through which knowledge is acquired relates to culture. What is culture? [Defining it a second time\\u2026] In the very end, it\\u2019s knowledge. That knowledge may take on physical form in the traditions of a culture, but it can also remain solely in the sphere of memory. If a culture is suppressed vehemently enough, it often recedes into the thoughts of those who cherish it, to be brought forth again when it is safe.  Language is essential to humanity. Of course it can limit us, but that is better than the alternative. [I don\\u2019t think I knew what the alternative was when I was writing this. The alternative would be a dearth of communication, a total inability for knowledge to be passed one. Sure, one can acquire knowledge, but one\\u2019s personal - firsthand - knowledge makes up only a small portion of one\\u2019s \\u201cexperiences\\u201d; it is by passing on knowledge between in across generations that culture is generated.] Knowledge is transferred by way of language. And every language has the ability to enrich the human experience. Every language is the product of a people\\u2019s experiences and travails; an audible tapestry that flows and morphs with time just as its speakers do. Language is instilled with the essence of a culture, even supposedly nonsense languages carry the weight of humanity, whether in a sense of childhood when speaking Pig Latin or community in using \\u201c\\u2019net lingo\\u201d.    god, this journal isn\\u2019t going anywhere.   3 July 2004    Starting anew, and hopefully this time it\\u2019ll be more coherent. And more profound. [Profoundness is a good thing?!]  Words are not universal. That is a given. But even if they don\\u2019t all manage to convey the same meaning, [there are universals:]human experiences - at their basest level - are essentially the same. I won\\u2019t use the love example, and thus end up on very dangerous ground, but attraction, curiosity, and repulsion are essentially constants. And - to be a bit daring - \\u201clove\\u201d is just a strong attraction. Anyone who thinks that love - \\u201ctrue\\u201d love - is irresistible, undying, and indestructible is merely deluding themselves. So I\\u2019m deluding myself.  Imagery is also nearly universal. Even badly translated works of literature originally rich in description are still moving. Pictures, as well, are worth a thousand words. Clich\\xe9s may be bad, but they\\u2019re true. A good picture conveys something beyond the realm of speech, something that reaches into the very essence of humanity, to the foundations of what it means to be human. A strong image distills language, association, and emotion into the most basic components, whatever it is that all humans have within themselves, what they use to identify what it means to be alive, and experiencing culture, and human.    I know, I\\u2019m waxing both philosophical and romantic, so I\\u2019ll stop.  Loss is another basic human emotion. Its derivative is sadness. Anger is one too. And the derivations of that: frustration, envy ,and spite.  Back to language. If Sapir and Wharf are correct, it either totally or partially dictates our perception. What about those born deaf? What do they use to dictate how they perceive the world around them, if anything?  I think that some extent the hypothesis is true, but even for those lacking hearing, there are still ways to convey meaning without language. I mean, they still form the same connections with one item and another, but they do not perceive the world in exactly the same way.  They also are deprived of the \\u201ccultural\\u201d value of language. But those are also just associations of partially-related or totally-unrelated object, entities, concepts, emotions with a given thing. \\u201cThing\\u201d is a nice short word. And I\\u2019m out of ideas.   \\t7 July 2004  So we need more \\u201cgood stuff\\u201d. Okay, let\\u2019s take a stab at it, shall we? With lots of analysis. Lots and lots and lots. [I know, it\\u2019s all crap. Forgive me.]  Analyse oneself. That always provides some form of production return. Let\\u2019s see\\u2026 someone in class said something about \\u201chiding something about yourself\\u201d, so that\\u2019s the logical starting place.    I\\u2019m gay.  That\\u2019s a relief; I wrote it - in pen no less - and it\\u2019s done. No, not really. Through the whole of human history (homo)sexuality has been a touchy topic. Okay, so now we analyse.  You know there isn\\u2019t much to analyse. I\\u2019m frustrated often, but far from being depressed - or suicidal. Governor\\u2019s School isn\\u2019t particularly helping either: I\\u2019m putting the entirety of a typical (or atypical) teenager\\u2019s personal issues and a pressing need for a good hug coupled with a long - long - face-to-face talk on hold for five weeks. And here isn\\u2019t really the best place - nor the most comfortable place - to work through - yes, \\u201cthrough\\u201d is a good preposition here [since you have to work through your problems, not around them] - my insecurities and curiosities and whatever else there is hiding somewhere in my subconscious. I want to go home.  And sure more and more people are finding out [here at Governor\\u2019s School] and I haven\\u2019t felt any enmity - distilled, diluted, or otherwise - so far but I\\u2019m in need of someplace to vent. I have no idea why it\\u2019s in my journal, but there\\u2019s no other place. I apologise; skip this paragraph if you wish. I hate being here. I\\u2019ve never met another gay guy in real life before - well, one where it was known that we both were gay, much less kissed anyone. And I\\u2019m stuck here. Stuck. Trapped. My friends finally know, and this summer was supposed to be one to remember, yet I\\u2019m fucking here, or all places. Not that I despise Governor\\u2019s School by any means, just that the \\u201copportunity cost\\u201d of being here is high. [And economic jargon begins its inevitable integration into my speech.] And there\\u2019s almost no way in all of hell I\\u2019d let - or want - something to happen here. I hate this; I need to stop; I\\u2019m lonely and unhappy and homesick. There, I said it. I\\u2019m fucking alone in the whole fucking world, or so it seems, and it fucking sucks.    [I have my blue moments, as I\\u2019m sure everyone does. That was one of them.]    I need to call Julie for a self-esteem boost; write more later. [I love you, Julie.]  Ethnocentrism and stereotyping are both bad. How do you avoid either? \\u201cHave an open mind\\u201d is the clich\\xe9d answer. What else? Embrace everything and anything, yet do not make generalisations. Essentially I\\u2019m trying to counteract both at the same time, but it\\u2019s inevitable one will tip one way or the other. But why do stereotypes persist? To be blunt, because they\\u2019re true. Generally true. Ethnocentrism? Well, for that there\\u2019s hardly an excuse, even a callous one. So I suppose it\\u2019s better to be slightly stereotypical instead of ethnocentric. [I still hold that opinion.]  Wait; there\\u2019s an epistemological question here: why - or may \\u201chow\\u201d is better - do we - or I - know that both ethnocentrism and stereotyping are bad? Ethnocentrism effectively allows one the right to trample all over someone else\\u2019s culture - and their associated values, traditions, and ideals. And that\\u2019s a bad thing; just trust me, it is. But what about stereotyping? It demeans people, I suppose. Well I more than just \\u201csuppose\\u201d - suppositions are flippant, but you get the idea. I think that this topic is getting boring, so I motion to advance to the next one.  Diversity. Is a term thrown around excessively by, well, everyone. [What else is it?] Yes, I do think it\\u2019s nice, but you can\\u2019t that so many things of great import and compress them into a single word. [I guess I was trying to say that the word \\u201cdiversity\\u201d is burdened with too many meanings, variants, facets.] Yes having a diverse group of acquaintances - not necessarily friends - can open one\\u2019s eyes, but that doesn\\u2019t work if they\\u2019re all hopelessly ignorant. But, having a more or less homogeneous group of acquaintances who are all open-minded and well-read can still confer part of the benefits reaped by living in the midst of a diverse society. Not all, mind you, but plenty. [Which is why I adore my friends. Not only are they a diverse bunch, they\\u2019re intelligent and supremely fun to be around. I love you guys.]  I think this is by far the longest entry. [My entries are not separated, unfortunately. The date divisions are just that - date divisions. In fact, one entry was written over midnight and so crosses a date division.] And my letter \\u201ca\\u2019s\\u201d are looking more and more like my \\u201co\\u2019s\\u201d. That\\u2019s not a good thing. I\\u2019ll write more later.   8 July 2004    I feel terrible writing during a class, but if he has to repeat that concept another time I\\u2019m going to shoot myself.  So, I need lots of analysis in this journal. And some way to lengthen this by another four pages, at least. [Handwritten, on college ruled paper.]  We\\u2019ve already gone over the basic emotions, but I\\u2019m in a mood to talk more. Attraction, repulsion, and loss are good ones. Or rather, love, hate, and loss. Or rather, hate, because I\\u2019m not in a particularly warm and fuzzy mood.  Why do humans \\u201chate\\u201d anything to begin with? Especially between cultures; conflicts often appear when cultures meet and have occurred as far back as the first civilisations. And the reasons? Misunderstanding, or even a simply refusal to understand? And with its advent, religion. Dun dun dun\\u2026 Sheer ignorance or all-consuming righteousness - generally on behalf of an \\u201cadvanced\\u201d Western civilization and its linked religion - usually leads to the collapse, of even the annihilation, of the \\u201cother side\\u201d. Cases in point - Africa and the Americas. Just because one feels that oneself is \\u201cbetter\\u201d than someone else does not mean that one has the right to impose one\\u2019s IdealsValuesReligionPerspective on someone else. And once again we hit the wall of stereotyping and ethnocentrism. [And what a common wall it is. Can we ever get beyond the wall? I doubt it.]    My thoughts were interrupted and so now I have no idea what I was going for. I\\u2019m sorry.  I\\u2019m sorry. Sorry for fucking everything. Every fucking atom in the cosmos. Because it\\u2019s all my fucking fault, that everyone hates me. People suck. They suck, plain and simple. My gaydar sucks, which only makes things infinitely more frustrating.    Don\\u2019t psychoanalyse, just read. I\\u2019m not suicidal.    And once again I forget the end to which I was heading. Fuck you all.    [Another blue moment. Don\\u2019t know where the hell that one came from, though.]   9 July 2004  I\\u2019m just going to end up writing in this every day. Well I need it: it\\u2019s a nice place to vent. Oh, and it\\u2019s rather nice to put down all my thoughts on paper.  I think I\\u2019m stuck in a rut. And a depressing rut at that. I spent well over an hour on a conference call with five friends. The content doesn\\u2019t matter, but it can be seen as a case of \\u201cintercultural communication\\u201d.  [So the five other people aren\\u2019t really friends. In fact, some probably hate each other. But they\\u2019re willing to sit there and help me hash through my insecurities and problems. And I love them for it. There was a lot more written here but it was nonsensical and dragged on forever.] Do you think different cliques in a high school each count as their own culture? Probably, especially if each group is well-insulated and things of itself as better than everyone else. Ethnocentrism? Or maybe just blinding ignorance and self-interest. But whatever the case, it happens; not to the magnitude of this hypothetical example [What hypothetical example? I think I lost my train of thought and went rambling again.], but it does happen. In some way, it\\u2019s almost like taking the world and shrinking it to a small population or a thousand or so. Not as diverse, and often much more liberal [Actually, a couple weeks of Governor\\u2019s School has proven to me there are young Bush supporters. My heart goes out to them, the poor bastards never had a chance.], than the world as a whole; but, in some creepy way, the social interactions align in pretty interesting patterns. And the student council, being - surprisingly - not just a popularity contest, is the body that arbitrates and facilitates interaction. [I think somewhere along the way it morphed from a \\u201chypothetical\\u201d example to my school.]    I really ought to go back to listening to \\u201cinternational political economy\\u201d   11 July 2004    There is not way in hell this is going to be fifteen pages. And typed. I apologise profusely. [Oh, the irony.]  So I went shopping - for clothes - today. Clothes are tied in to culture, aren\\u2019t they? [And who cares if they\\u2019re not? I like clothes.] Every culture or subculture - co-culture for all the politically correct people out there - has added its own flair or input on the basic components of apparel. Especially in wealthy developed countries (i.e. the United States), one\\u2019s manner of dress does so much to project one\\u2019s identity. Or not necessarily a true identity, as one can also use clothes to mask one\\u2019s own identity. [Clothes often reinforce stereotypes.] Sure, taste is entirely a subjective thing, but within a given group it is still somewhat codified to ensure some degree of homogeneity. Because everyone wishes to belong to one or many cultures, and clothes are an easy way of doing so.  Clothes convey social status with a mere glance. They can also convey one\\u2019s interests or beliefs, although less frequently. Adamant Bush supporters don\\u2019t wear t-shirts likening Bush to a monkey just as the rich and famous don\\u2019t wear just \\u201cordinary\\u201d clothes. Non-verbal communication at its finest.  \\u201cThe meeting of cultures creates disparities in societal norms\\u201d. [Somebody said in class.] Well of course, seeing as how cultures are a composite of the values and experiences of a given group of people. And by \\u201cgiven group\\u201d, I assume the members of the group are relatively homogeneous, not just a random clumping of people utterly unlike each other in any way. So of course their societal norms - and extension of ethics - are not going to mesh perfectly.  \\u201cWithout the correct feedback, it is human to doubt oneself.\\u201d Is it ever. I\\u2019m close to being one of the most insecure people ever, almost completely unfunctional without at least a friend beside me at all times. Pathetic, yes, but I seem to have trouble relating actual, received feedback with the outcomes I\\u2019ve already mapped in my head. And yes, I do map outcomes in my head. [I\\u2019m not sure where this came from either. Writing longhand causes weird thought patterns. Or not necessarily weird, different. And being different isn\\u2019t a bad thing, they say.]  Feedback is so crucial to a successful conversation in any medium. Beyond the fact that feedback is essentially what makes up a conversation - a verbal response, a typed response, etc. - other, more subtle, forms of feedback are also important. For example, sometimes you really don\\u2019t want to talk to a certain person. So you send subtle signs - non-verbal signs - to tell them you\\u2019re bored shitless and would appreciate it greatly if they would kindly hurl themselves off a cliff. Generally one can make the conversation as awkward as possible by trying to remain as silent as possible, both in person and on the Internet. I feel bad implying I ignore people on purpose, but whatever.    Okay, I really don\\u2019t want to write any more.   12 July 2004  [This last entry was added for no reason whatsoever. No; in retrospect it was probably added to increase the journal\\u2019s length. Feel free to ignore it.]  Communication without feedback. Feedback without communication. Neither is possible since communication is essentially the interplay of feedback in both the verbal and non-verbal components. That sentence made no sense. I was thinking of chiaroscuro, but that has nothing to do with intercultural communications. And how can you have feedback occur without the occurrence of communication? Not really possible since feedback almost always results in communication.  Gestures. You know, those really pointless actions demanded by Society. \\u201cHow d\\u2019you do?\\u201d and all that bullshit. It\\u2019s all been pounded into us since the age of zero so that there are entire conversations without an iota of feeling. But that can still count as communication, given a definition of communication where the feedback does not need any form of vested interest, just an exchange of symbols. And the meaning behind the symbols is\\u2026 being nice, genial, amiable.  What crap.    Okay, ta ta.   15 July 2004    So I\\u2019m writing again. I don\\u2019t know why, or about what, but I\\u2019m writing.  I had such a good topic, but I forgot it. Dammit. So I\\u2019ll write about music. Music conveys feelings. [What is that? The seventeenth time I\\u2019ve said that?] Especially wistfulness. I\\u2019ve been rather passive lately. The \\u201cshopping high\\u201d wore off, so I\\u2019m back to my lonely, carping self. And I\\u2019m listening to sappy music. Or maybe because I\\u2019ve been listening to heart-wrenching music, I\\u2019m once again back to sad-Nan.    \\u201cThere are lots of fish in the sea,\\u201d Julie says. Lots and lots of fish. Write more later. I think I offended a friend tonight. [It must have been near midnight when I wrote this, because this entry spans a date marker.] A really close friend. And really badly. I feel like shit, like I need someone - or something - to talk to. I hate this, why does everyone take everything I say with such gravity? Or rather, some people take me at my word while others never think I\\u2019m being serious. [Neither is a good thing, dammit.]  I\\u2019m really fucking sorry; what else can I say? And you. You\\u2019re her boyfriend - her best friend. How can you just blow it off? How dare you just blow it off?   16 July 2004    How DARE you show no emotion whatsoever while I\\u2019m sitting here, in anguish, losing fucking sleep over it? WHAT THE HELL?!    \\u201cI; I have become, comfortably numb\\u201d, the music says. No, I haven\\u2019t. I made a careless slip and now Kaitlin hates me.  This isn\\u2019t intercultural communication, it\\u2019s basic communication. The human experience in all its wonder and evil, happiness and heart-wrenching misery; all melded together in one pitiful and insignificant life. One. Such a pathetic number in and of itself.  Does life ever become so unbearable that you - ? I suppose it can. Maybe not indefinitely, but it can. And for that one infitesmal moment, it can seem as if the tradeoff is worth it. And that\\u2019s what scares me. As if? What if it is worth it?     Shine on you crazy diamond.    What is a life worth? I don\\u2019t; maybe it\\u2019s all relative. [I believe I meant to say \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d.] How can such a simple question not have a simple answer? [Lots of simple questions have complex answers, or no answers at all.] How can this most basic - as basic as the sun, moon, stars - of questions still require a relativist answer? Is nothing universal in its being;  is nothing sacred?  [I\\u2019m not completely sure why I associated universals with sacredness.]     And you run and you run to catch up with the sun       but it\\u2019s sinking; racing around to come up behind you again.       The sun is the same in a relative way but you\\u2019re older:       shorter of breath and one day closer to death.    \\t     Adieu.  I forgot to cap a brand new bottle of white-out and I put it in my bookbag. No relation whatsoever to anything, it just sucks. A lot. And this gross new formulation doesn\\u2019t come off very easily. [Or at all, seeing as how my notebooks still remain splattered with what appears to be white paint.] And it feels icky on my fingers. Why can\\u2019t they just stick with the old brush [as opposed to a new, foam one] and the old, crappy formula? Change can too be bad. Such as this case. The brush just sucks and it\\u2019s supposed to be correction fluid, not permanent paint. Oh, and it still smells terrible. So really, there wasn\\u2019t improvement. In fact, the white-out company appears to be retrogressing.  Things you believe you can\\u2019t have are as good as things you can\\u2019t have. And that sucks, [but you can\\u2019t change your mind to believe you can have something if you\\u2019ve already decided it\\u2019s unattainable, no matter how hard you try.] The mind is a truly wondrous thing [in its ability to fuck you over]; it\\u2019s almost as good as real life. Maybe better.  I think the one and only purpose in life is to find satisfaction. Or, in even more blunt terms, happiness. In some way, any way. I need some happiness in my life. What else can someone want? I suppose everyone obtains satisfaction in a different way: wealth, power, spite, altruism. But in the end, it is the same goals. Humans don\\u2019t share very much in common with each other, but this they do share. The same ones at least. [No idea where this was headed or how it got here, sorry.]   18 July 2004    I don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019m supposed to write, but I\\u2019ll write something anyways.  Mobile communication. The next big thing. Not only cell phones, or even the super cell phones that can check e-mail and send video or whatnot. But internet access from alongside every major highway and in every major city. That is the next big thing. Even now, with wireless hotspots as the newest \\u201cin\\u201d thing, people are beginning to like - and become accustomed to - the technology.  Ohh, big point. When someone becomes accustomed to something, they begin to expect it. And that\\u2019s not a good thing. Westerners are accustomed to too many things. And so they expect the world to be handed to them on a silver platter.    Dinner.    Back from dinner and ICONS. Oh, I was having so much fun, my head could explode. Positively explode.  We - as Americans - feel like we\\u2019re entitled to too much. Like it\\u2019s our fucking birthright. [Hell, the land we live on isn\\u2019t even our birthright.] But why? Is society propagating our lifestyle? Probably. Can we change it? I don\\u2019t know, can we? If we all gave up something - Hummer, golf courses, rare wood furniture - wouldn\\u2019t we all be better off? The first \\u201cwe\\u201d is Americans; the second, the world. To satisfy the United Nations\\u2019 daily water requirement for all six-something billion people on this planet, it would take 2.5 billion gallons of acceptably clean water a day. The worlds\\u2019 golf courses use 2.8 billion gallons of water a day. What an epitome of the bourgeois spirit - an activity that requires an enormous expenditure of water and land seemingly to make sure that the planet would be deprived of limited resources.  How can you get across a foreign concept to someone totally and utterly opposed to your viewpoint - largely out of breeding? Indoctrination is a powerful tool. Is it possible to defeat it, however? Not from within, I don\\u2019t think. But there are no outside forces powerful enough. So is the answer no? Is there not some method one can use to get one\\u2019s point across? Even if the other party provides no feedback whatsoever, is it possible to transcend bias and prejudice - and all the collected experiences that came before - and provide sufficient reasoning for a good argument?  It\\u2019d take more than words. Words don\\u2019t have enough power. Words cannot, in themselves, convey every nuance of human emotion. The symbol component may have once held power, but the meaning has been too degraded, too diluted, too limited to hold much power anymore.    And for that I\\u2019m sorry.   21 July 2004  In global citizenship today we were talking about weblogs. I have one. This is going on it. Because at first I thought about continuing these journals beyond Governor\\u2019s School but then I realised there are more effective places to put down my thoughts. Digitsed information lasts longer than paper. Especially when something is written in water-soluble pen. [In fact, I\\u2019m destroying the original copied of my journals after I\\u2019m done with Governor\\u2019s School; this will be all that remains.]  The internet is an amazing thing. I keep a public record of my thoughts on it. It\\u2019s the most sophisticated method of communication every devised by humans. It evolves and improves constantly; it hold no allegiance to any entity; it can create and destroy lives - both real and digital; it goes beyond what anyone in Renaissance Florence could have possibly imagined; or even people at the end of World War II. It now defines a significant part of the developed world - or at least the culture and methods of communication in the developed world - and it seems likely that the internet will only grow in power and efficiency.  Instant messaging is an interesting method of communication. But not a novel idea, really. It\\u2019s like walkie talkies in words. Or really fast telegrams. Sure, it\\u2019s more cost-efficient - and more efficient period - but it\\u2019s not an enormous jump between sending e-mails to sending really short e-mails in real-time.  It gives you time to think. Much like all writing. You generally tread more carefully since non-verbal communication is absent; things can be easily misconstrued or taken literally when one doesn\\u2019t mean it. Instant messaging can also get one into a lot of bad situations - it\\u2019s too damn easy to lie or dissemble, or to be so neurotic as to believe the other party is lying. You come to realise the inflection of one\\u2019s voice makes up an enormous amount of communication.  New topic. What makes sex such an irreconcilable item between men and women? Beyond the biological factors, I mean. [Is there much beyond those, though?] The cultural factors. That men are often rewarded or commended for asserting their sexuality in a way that their dominance - supposed dominance, I should say - over women is obvious. Why does society persist in maintaining such a double-standard? Because back in \\u201cthe day\\u201d, men maintained their superior position through brute strength - something that mattered quite a bit in the Stone age - and somehow have kept that position over the past however-many millennia?  Okay, that topic got boring fast. \\u201cWhat if you use derogatory labels but you don\\u2019t mean it?\\u201d In other words, the word \\u201cgay\\u201d. Beyond reinforcing the homophobia of society, it deeply ingrains a terrible stigma in the word, often without the user realising it. In informal polls, almost everyone that has firmly declared themselves to be open and accepting persists in using \\u201cgay\\u201d or \\u201cfaggot\\u201d - and its myriad variations - as curses or insults. And then I come out to my friends and almost all use of the world ceases. Amusing, no? And now whenever someone does slip inadvertently, there\\u2019s an almost palpable cringe and awkward silence. That\\u2019s amusing.    The end.   25 July 2004  These are getting increasingly sporadic; I feel bad. But individual entries are getting longer. Hopefully it will work out in the end.  Everything works out in the end; that\\u2019s part of my theory on life. Ever the optimist, stuck in my world fabricated from wishful thoughts. People say I trust in other too much. I think I trust in them enough - such that we are all conferred the status of rational beings, and rational beings are good in the end.  I\\u2019m relaxed and content. It\\u2019s really nice. We had to \\u201ccheck in\\u201d again tonight, but I\\u2019m still in a mood to ponder. The past couple days have been pretty damned amazing, especially since I met someone who\\u2019d make an absolutely amazing friend. But that person lives here [Pittsburgh] and I live five hours away. So it\\u2019s true you meet awesome people here, but you may never have the chance to just sit in a coffeehouse and relax with them, which sucks. Instant messaging and phone calls really aren\\u2019t good enough; it takes someone\\u2019s physical presence sometimes. You know, those people who are entrancing in person but almost blas\\xe9 otherwise. That\\u2019s a major low point right now. But you just have to push it off center stage and seat it next to the box labeled \\u201cschool-assigned summer work for the 2004-2005 school year\\u201d.  Society dictates a lot of things. Is that a good or bad thing? If we were all free-thinking - and I suppose ideal - beings, then an utterly unstructured society might not be so bad. There would be no need for laws if we could all make the rational choice. But we don\\u2019t, so Society is always there to ensure we make the \\u201cright\\u201d choice.  There are decisions we make for ourselves - or that we believe we make for ourselves - and those so deeply ingrained in us that we see only one choice that would be considered \\u201clogical\\u201d to take. In fact, some decisions are so impossible to escape that we don\\u2019t realise we\\u2019re making a choice. They\\u2019re transparent and pervasive. Like culture, in fact.  We constantly make choices we\\u2019re only slightly aware of. Or ones we\\u2019re completely oblivious to. Many many times in a second. Such as why I\\u2019m not stopping this journal and heading off to mingle or why I should jump on a coffee table and start doing the Macarena. Because there\\u2019s no one to mingle with at the moment and because it\\u2019d be ridiculous and embarrassing. Why? Because Society told me it would and has taught every to look upon anyone who commits - yes, commits, like a crime - such an act as an imbecile and to point and laugh accordingly. Moreover, Society has made it perfectly clear that being pointed and laughed at is a bag thing.   27 July 2004.    Last journal entry for Governor\\u2019s School.',\n",
       " \"Today I finally finished up building this wretched thing.  Last night I glued in what at the time was a perfect windshield.

Yep, that right, no air conditioning because the motor runs \"too hot\" as it is, and adding air conditioning would probably fry the thing. Get this- while driving 5 MPH in a parade our car temperature gage is halfway between C & H, however, when driving 80 MPH down the interstate in third gear the gage is leaning on H and you can smell anti-freeze. My mechanic father and I believe that the shaft in the water pump (which the fan blade is bolted to) is slipping at higher RPMs, thus pumping less anti-freeze/ water through the motor. At lower RPMs, however, the slippage is less, thus causing virtually no change in water temperature.',\n",

Browser customization is probably the feature that I love the most about Firefox- something that the communist Microsoft Corporation hates.  Mozilla Firefox is what computer geeks call Open Source, which (as Dictionary.com puts it) is a method and philosophy for software licensing and distribution designed to encourage use and improvement of software written by volunteers by ensuring that anyone can copy the source code and modify it freely. This means that if I wanted to, I could write an extension for Firefox, possibly improve the software for some users, and share it freely.

The main purpose of this blog? Essay writing. Alot like www.everything2.com . But our goal is improving our writing ablity, whereas their goal is sharing knowledge, and writing really neat stuff. So, obviously you're not going to be reading this blog for good writers.  So, the name.. yeah, I had trouble with that one. My description of it? Alphabet soup, the blog for fictional stories, is a letter soup. You can arrange the letters however you want. The sister blog, which deals with essays, is non-fictional stuff, just a presentation of information. Noodles can be bent and stuff, and presented differently, but they are still the same noodle, the same info.  Wether or not people actually pick up on that, well, that's their problem.

       " \"Well I was hoping today would be uneventful and boring, but my hopes were soon shattered by a little bunny.  One of my cats was chasing the little fellow around the house. He put a few teeth holes in it's little furry back. I saved the bunny from a slimy toothy doom, and now he's sitting in my old empty rat cage. The poor thing hasn't moved for atleast an hour. I can tell he's alive though. His eyes are wide open, staring down the throat of an imaginary cat.   My grandmother told me to let him out into the wild. I carried him via towel to the front lawn, but he just sat there, looking at the imaginary cat again. She insisted that I just leave him there, but I couldn't do that. I was prepared to do anything to make sure this little insignificant ball of blood and fur and organs breathe another day. I don't know why.  Alot of people save rabbits from death everyday. You'd think they were doing the rabbits a favor. The sad truth is, all living things die for a reason. That reason is called Natural Selection, or Evolution. Now, when we save a rabbit, are we doing the rabbit species a favor, or just the opposite?\",\n",

People with problems of my creations. I want to be the GOD of my own world.   Think about that for a second. If I can create with nothing but pencil and paper, couldn't the creator of me and you have done somthing similar? I'm not saying that I beleive in a god.

I have a tiny desk with two monitors, covered in coke cans, a dresser I don't even use, an empty rat cage sitting in the middle of the room, ANOTHER desk covered in junk, and basically a bunch of other furniture I have no use for at all.   My mom doesn't seem to understand the concept of getting rid of junk. Our house is overflowing with furniture we do not need, and do not use, just hogging up space. Whenever I walk into someone elses home, I am simply amazed by how nice and neat and pretty things are.  Now, when I walk into my OWN home, I feel horribly claustrophobic. I wonder if my mom realises how much money she could earn by selling some of our stuff. We have a rather large pool table in our den. You can hardly play without your stick hitting the wall while trying to make a shot. Although this is hardly a problem, seeing as we never use the damn thing anyways, unless a shelf for laundry baskets really counts as using it. We also have a ping pong table, folded up on the deck, because we have no place for it to fit, and, even if we did, we wouldn't use it. I could really go on and on about all the different monstrous peices of useless furniture in my house.  So, anyways, I had a really nice idea today. There is a room next to mine, it's pretty much empty at the moment. I  decided I could connect it to my room with a door way, and make it an extension to my room. Mainly a room for rabbits and rats. I never did have adequate space in my current room to take care of rats. Rats need room to run around, you can't just keep them in their cage. I'd also move into that room my bed. Now, take this, plus a little convincing to my mom to get rid of all the other junk in my room i'm not using, and i'll be able to BREATHE again!  I've wanted to setup a little entertainment center on a single wall of my room. Nothing too big. Just a medium sized TV with some shelves around it, and maybe 2 beanbag chairs. Nothing but that on the wall. Then, on the other side of the room, in a nice open area, i'd place my computer desk. In the other room, a single bed, a 4 foot tall, 2 feet wide, rat tower/cage, a rabbit cage, and all kinds of toys for the rabbit and the rats to enjoy. Mostly just air, though, and that is what is important.   I feel i've ranted quite enough for now. I need to go talk to my mom about getting rid of all our junk now.\",\n",

Here is what I wrote down:  You play an alien trapped in the deep labrynthine walls of Area 51.  The game is a top-down grid puzzle game, much like \"Chip\\'s Challenge\", in which you walk through a grid map, finding keys, pushing crates, pulling levers, doing whatever you can to reach the exit of the level, and make it further out of area 51.  The spin: As an alien, you are a little more advanced then Humans. You have psychic powers, which you can use to do a number of tasks, such as flipping an out of reach switch, pushing an out of reach crate, or even controlling a patrol guard, etc.  Now all I need to do is think up each of the puzzle elements, and how they will be made graphically. Not as easy as it sounds.  So, the alien uses telekenesis to solve problems, and thus we need problems to put use to these powers. This is where the real thinking begins, and my creativity is put to the test. Puzzle games are rather difficult to create, as they should be. If they aren\\'t hard to think up, they won\\'t be hard to solve.   And thus I sit, at 4:00 AM, and brainstorm.  Maybe some sleep will make it easier to think. G\\'night folks.',\n",

My mom and brother enjoyed the movie, they said so themselves. In fact, to quote directly from my brother, \"It wasn\\'t that bad.

       " '[The following post has been rated \"Really Boring\", for excessive ranting about things you probably don\\'t give a damn about. You have been warned.]  I like making games. Well, trying, atleast. I\\'ve never actually finished a game before, only started  alot of projects that were really way too extreme and large for me to actually finish them. I haven\\'t started any new projects in quite awhile, but recently I\\'ve had a sudden urge to start it up again. This time i\\'ll take up a strategy in my game planning.  [You don\\'t have to read any of this, I just feel like typing it out. I\\'m not trying to make this post interesting in any way.l]  So, I\\'ve decided to make small pathetic games. No big epic ones. Just for now, atleast. There\\'s something about playing you\\'re own creation that gives you a strong feel of satisfaction in yourself, and when you work on a game for a very long time with nothing to actually play, you get bored with the project. Now, I could take a bunch of side projects, and have a big project that I work on back and forth, but I don\\'t think that\\'s enough. I think I should take on a big project, and instead of getting too ahead of myself in planning, I\\'ll slowly code and create beta versions. Like,  feild with the character in all his animated glory, with all the engine stuff coded.   [Have you really made it this far? Really, you can stop reading.]  Hmm, so, like I said i\\'ve taken on alot of projects. I beleive my first big one was...no..or was it...nope. There are too many to even remember. I remember a GTA type game in which you take up missions, in a top down space shooter style, like asteroids. And a \"School Simulator\". That one was weird, yet I still think it would have been great if I finished it. Basically, you go through the school year, but what made it interesting was it was driven by a very large choice branch system, so, every choice you makes changes the rest of the game. There would be no test taking, grades would be based on your characters additude I suppose, or, possibly, when you arrive home from school you choose a certain ammount of effort to put into studying (and you\\'d be limited on your choices based on your characters stats) and then that would effect waking up and all that stuff. You can probably begin to see why I never finished this, or anything else I started.   Oh, and the cat RPG. That was a good one. (atleast I think so) You start the game by choosing between to cats, Smokey or Kidd. (I would post pictures but i\\'m not at my home computer. Maybe i\\'ll edit the post when I get home.) The idea was that Kidd and Smokey (two rather large male cats) were fighting over who was the head cat of the neighborhood. Smokey, the house cat, would obviously start in a house. The gameplay would be as follows, you travel around the RPG style maps, finding various cats. Each cat would request a favor, or an item, or many a thing, in exchange for their alleigence. For instance, at the start of Smokey\\'s quest you would first hafto get your furry ass out of the house. In order to do so you would hafto push some things out of the way, but the only cat with the push skill is Willow. Once finding willow, he would ask you for a favor of somesort, and upon completing whatever task was handed to you, Willow would join your party, and thus, give you access to more areas. I was going to have different areas to get into, thus having each play through of the game different then the last, by having some kind of limit on the cats you get on your team. I really favored replayability.   [Seriously, go do somthing productive.]  The only game I think I\\'ve ever really finished was \"Poke\". I kept \"poking\" people in the eye on AIM, and felt inspired to make a game, in which you ran around a box area, chasing eyeballs, and then poking them to destroy them, while at the same time running from a giant evil hand, trying to poke you, as well. I only made about 3 levels, but it was fun, and quick. I might not make games THAT simple, but still pretty simple.  I\\'m hungry now.

The blog is mainly so I can practice my writing skills, and maybe have a little fun and make new friends with it.    You also seem to think that, if a person knows other people are reading their blog they won\\'t be as free in what they write. That\\'s true for some people, but most of those people really only have a blog so that maybe somebody out there will see their angsty unimportant troubles and feel amazingly sorry for them. They just want attention is all. I mean, I don\\'t doubt for a second that alot of blogs out there suck. But, they aren\\'t obligated to be interesting. In other words: Why are you bashing something that is not doing any harm to anyone?  But what really pissed me off is how you went on and on about how all journals are uninteresting to be read by other people, and then decided to say that you hope someone would read your journal someday, because, it is actually worth reading.  Online or offline, public or private, they both share their drawbacks. To be honest I wouldn\\'t stick with a private blog/journal for more than a week.  It\\'s  kind of like a personal confession booth. My brother reads my blog, and, without that, I wouldn\\'t be as close to him as I am now. I\\'m an awfully shy person when it comes to talking in person, and especially discussing my problems with other people. Online, though, I lose most of that anxiety. Even more so when writing to my blog.

We\\'re all at the mercy of the limbic system, clouds of electricity drifting through the brain. Every man is broken into twenty-four-hour fractions, and then again within those twenty-four hours. It\\'s a daily pantomime, one man yielding control to the next: a backstage crowded with old hacks clamoring for their turn in the spotlight. Every week, every day. The angry man hands the baton over to the sulking man, and in turn to the sex addict, the introvert, the conversationalist. Every man is a mob, a chain gang of idiots.  This is the tragedy of life. Because for a few minutes of every day, every man becomes a genius. Moments of clarity, insight, whatever you want to call them. The clouds part, the planets get in a neat little line, and everything becomes obvious. I should quit smoking, maybe, or here\\'s how I could make a fast million, or such and such is the key to eternal happiness. That\\'s the miserable truth. For a few moments, the secrets of the universe are opened to us. Life is a cheap parlor trick.

From all the excitment i didn;t notice untill now that my whole area had been hit by a chemical bomb! I suddenly heard a moaning sound from behind me, startled I turned around to be confronted with a horde of flesh eating zombies! THE CHEMICAL BOMB TURNED MY NEIGHBORHOOD INTO ZOMBIES! I whipped out my trusty shotgun and pursued my way to the street out of my neighborhood shooting zombies left and right, i had 100 feet to go and I was out of ammo! There were still zombies all around me, I chucked the gun into one, but there were still many many more. I looked around for an escape as they slowly closed in on me, then right out of nowhere a T-REX COMES AND CHOMPS THEM ALL UP! I am releived for a short second untill i realize I am face to face with a tarranasauras rex!!! AAAH! I ren into the nearest home barely escaping the sharp jaws of he beast. I know I am not safe so I seek cover in the best safe spot I can find. the SMAAAASH! The roof caves in , a giant foot scrapes the tip of my nose as I jump back in fright...OK OK...thats not what happened...  Here is what really happened... I woke up from a really wierd dream which i don\\'t care to explain right now, I did some boring stuff on my computer, played an extremely fun and exciting game of DDR (DDR could never be boring) and ate a boring bowl of cereal. Then I went back up to my boring room, sat in my boring chair and did more boring stuff. Followed by a very boring game of sit and do nothing. Upon finishing i realized it was boring old lunch time, I ate a boring sandwich with boring chicken chees tomatos and mayonaise. My friend played 30 minutes of boring gamecube and went away to his boring home to see a boring movie with his friends, leaving me to be even more bored then I was. Then I did more boring stuff for a couple hours, then ate boring macaroni for dinner. Then I played more DDR and now all the boring stuff from earlier doesn\\'t matter because DDR always makes me happy! ^_^  Well, Be seeing ya! posted by BuddytheRat at 8:07 PM\"   That really was what most of my days consisted of a year ago. Listening to techno, sitting around being bored, obsessing a little too much over Dance Dance Revolution. Then blurrpi came along, and everything just changed so rapidly. She changed the music I listened to, got me interested in reading, and philosophy, and knowledge. Then I became sort of an elitist, without really noticing or caring at first. She told me it\\'s hard not to, which I agree with, but I still was mad at myself for it, and then, as blurrpi always does, she gave me some advice that completely changed my way of thinking.    Blurrpi: My friend Tracy and I spend most of our time making fun of one another.  She calls me an elitist bastard. Blurrpi: It\\'s just because I have the taste I do. Blurrpi: I mean, it started as that.  She\\'d say she\\'s reading some silly teenage novel about some girl that wants to commit suicide, I\\'d make a face. Blurrpi: But after a while we just began goofing on one another.  She thinks I\\'m an elitist, even though I don\\'t think I\\'m that snobby about it, simply because of my taste.  I accept that she views me as an elitist bastard, she accepts that I view her as liking trivial crap. Blurrpi: No matter what if you say you like Adaptation people will call you a pretentious elitist. Blurrpi: You can\\'t avoid it. Blurrpi: Heh.  All you can do is have the people that you care about/care about you understand your taste, and you understand theirs, and live comfortably without hoping to change one another.  If you try to change other people because of your choices, then we have a problem. Blurrpi: But if you simply discuss and enjoy and such, don\\'t worry.   What she said made perfect sense, but it didn\\'t quite stick untill now, after i\\'ve read through my old blog. I was so nice to people back then. Now i\\'m a pretentious bastard.  Realising you\\'ve made a mistake can be kind of nerve racking, but learning to correct that mistake is one of the most gratifying feelings in the world.

Thinking back it was all a haze, except the big finale of the movie, which I didn\\'t understand because of my lack of attention at the beginning. Gah, so pissed.  So, after watching who knows what, and walking out of the theatre, Brother #1 decided he wanted to take the long route through the mall so he could have some ice cream, from a place he claims makes the best ice cream ever. It tasted like any other ice cream i\\'ve ever had, except that it was expensive as hell. Before it was even handed to me it was already sort of melting. \"Too much cream and not enough ice.\" I thought. I couldn\\'t eat faster than it could melt, so by the time I was int he car it was all over my hand. I put it in a cup and gave it to brother #2. I wanted to say to Brother #1, \"Brother #1, your taste in ice cream is alot like your taste in movies.\" but at the last second I changed it to, \"Your taste in ice cream sucks.\"  I\\'m not sure why I made the last second change.

       " 'I\\'ve wanted to write about evolution for awhile, so here I go.  Evolution\\'s struggle, is when humanity and evolution begin to grind into eachother, slowing eachother down. As we evolve from apes, to cavemen, to the humans we are now, we suddenly reach a grinding halt.  When you try to imagine a human race much more evolved then now, a perfect race, it scares you. Everything would be equal, everything would be flat, and boring. But, we wouldn\\'t feel boredom. We wouldn\\'t feel anything at all. Emotions are worthless. But we love them, and can\\'t possibly imagine being without them. Thus the grinding between evolution and tradition. Irony in it\\'s purest form. We love to love, yet love holds us back.  Is evolution continually slowing down? Will it reach the climax of it\\'s grinding and then suddenly sky rocket? I have no fuckin\\' idea. I don\\'t know much about the topic. I am glad for the people of the future. They will cherish the flat equality of their world as we cherish the chaotic waves of our own.  I\\'m not going to talk about the topic anymore, because I really have no clue what in the hell i\\'m talking about. It sure is fun to think about though.  You know, I am starting to think that thinking, all by itself, makes a person smarter. I remember hearing that einstien used to sit in a chair for hours, staring at a wall, just thinking. Not letting other people\\'s thoughts disturb him. (TV is a good example of that.) The mind, filled constantly with it\\'s surroundings, never having time to actually think and act on it\\'s own. The brain, by itself, is the key to everything.   A friend of mine and I always have this argument about escapeism. I\\'m into lucid dreaming, dreaming consciously. Not day dreaming, but taking control of you\\'re actual nightly dreams. (If you don\\'t beleive me, look at www.ld4all.com) Slowly I am starting to agree with her. It\\'s weird, but no matter how much I disagree with her, it always seems to creep it\\'s way into my mind and  change  me. I don\\'t even know if it\\'s a concious or subconsious happening, but it happens.   We\\'re ALWAYS thinking, constantly. Sometimes it happens without us even acknowledging it. It\\'s crazy, but our minds know the answers, and if we hear the truth, we automatically accept it. Not right away, but after awhile, we realise, because it\\'s the truth, and our minds know it. I didn\\'t read this, I just thought it up. I\\'m not bragging, i\\'m just backing up the fact that our minds know everything.  Or maybe they don\\'t? I don\\'t know. Or do I? I don\\'t care. Do we have a limit? Can I think so much that I can\\'t think anymore? I\\'ll just hafto keep thinking to find out. But will I never find out? I\\'ll probably die before than.   Maybe all the brilliant people in the world just thought more often then others? I mean, we think all the time, but, like I said, mostly we are thinking the thoughts orbiting around us, filling our minds. Visual thoughts, auditory thoughts, and so so much more. I wonder how cleary a person could think in complete darkness, with medicine to completely numb all feeling in their body? Would their thoughts just skyrocket? I want to try that. I really, seriously, want to try that. My own little experiment with thought.  God, I just don\\'t want to stop typing, I don\\'t want to stop thinking now. I\\'m trapped in the glory of thinking and learning without any external sources. But am I really learning? Like I said I don\\'t know. Or do I? Wait, we\\'ve done this already. Is that the stopping point of my thought train? Is that where I can\\'t think anymore? I mean, I can go back and take other tracks, but when I reach that one point I also end up asking questions, instead of stating what might be facts. I wish I could break that wall. Could I? I don\\'t know.   How many side tracks can I take untill I run out and have nothing else but the wall? Is it infinite? Is it not? I just.. don\\'t know. Maybe I need complete peace to find it out. My completely numb, non-visual, non-auditory, thinking mode. I\\'d even request that I be blindfolded, then carried to a place i\\'ve never been to, so I can\\'t even imagine where I might be. I\\'d still imagine other places though, wouldn\\'t I? It\\'s impossible to think completely clearly, or is it? I don\\'t think it is. I don\\'t beleive in the impossible. I can damn well try though, can\\'t I? I fucking will try.  It\\'s neat how everything links up. If I think of one thing long enough, I\\'ll could end up anywhere else. A crazy web of connections. Is there anything at all that isn\\'t connected to anything else? Becuase of that, is it impossible to reach? Maybe it is connected, it\\'s just blocked, by the wall I talked about. I\\'m just rambling now, but, I have been rambling this whole post. If I don\\'t stop seen nobody will take the time to read this. I don\\'t care if they do. They could always think of it themselves. They have the ability to do that. (Or do they?)   I know why I started to hate my post about \"The Day After Tomorrow\". I was being prejudice to people just like me. It\\'s not their fault. Nothing is anybody\\'s fault. Blame is a horrible word. A horrible horrible word. You know, now that i\\'m in this thinking mode of everyone being equal, i\\'m starting to think maybe we ARE in that flat land of the future. But maybe not. I don\\'t know.  Maybe I do need other people\\'s thoughts to help me along. Maybe I need to stack a shitload of books next to the wall, so I can climb upward, and once I reach the top of the wall, I\\'ll be high enough to jump to the strange unconnected, hidden land of thoughts. I won\\'t be able to get back though, or will I? Will I take everything from the other side of the wall with me and connect it myself?   I sure love metaphors. Maybe I use them too much? I don\\'t know. I hafto stop. I will stop now, so you can read this. I don\\'t hafto type everything I think. I can think after I stop typing. So NYAH!  The end..',\n",

       " 'urlLink Travis  and I were digging around in my brother\\'s old room the other day. We found alot of great things, such as my old  urlLink SNES Mouse . The little mouse that takes the place of the controller,  and is used in certain games, such as  urlLink Mario Paint .   I also found, as the title implies, a book.  Catch-22 . A friend told me a little about this book, she said it was pretty good, so I kept it and started reading it. Upon opening the book I was very surprised to see my mother\\'s name, with the last name she had before she married my dad, drawn on the inside of the front cover in half bubble, half normal lines, like a middle or highschooler might have done. She obviously read this book a very long time ago, I\\'d guess sometime in highschool.  Than I reach page four, and find some underlined text. That\\'s pretty normal. But on the opposite page, page 5, to the right of all the text is the word, \" urlLink *M*A*S*H* \" written vertically along the edge of the page, for no apperant reason. Two more pages later it re-appears. In the same place on the page as last time. But to the right of it, also vertically, it says, \"-again-\".  A little later, I noticed on the front of the book, where the numbers \"22\" are printed in rather large stylistic letters, a small imprint, left by a pen or something, lining the inside of the numbers.   I found this to be very funny. Not merely because of what is written, but because it was written by my mom when she was a kid. Intresting to think if she intended for the future holder of the book to see the notes or not. I wonder how she would react if I showed it to her.

       " '[Warning: The following post contains spoilers to both Spiderman 2 and the book 1984.]   Just got back from seeing Spiderman 2. I enjoyed it. And now I shall discuss it... with.. myself.   In the movie, Peter loses his powers, because he distanced himself from Mary Jane, and is on the verge of losing her completely. Later in the movie, Mary Jane is captured, and he miraculously gets his powers back. This doesn\\'t bother me in the least. Superhero movies call for superhero logic.   Just like the last movie, the end, and the basic moral of the story I liked the most. Here we have Spiderman, fighting crime, helping the City. Here we have Peter, late for class, exhausted, losing Mary because of his web-slinging counter-part. So he quits. (Half because of his loss of powers, half because he wants what is best for Peter. He wants what is best for himself, instead of the city.) This reminds me of the end of 1984, which I finished reading recently, where Winston gives into the Party, and lets them control his mind because he stopped caring about Julia, and had nobody to love but himself. And then, the best line of the whole movie, when Mary leaves the guy she was going to marry, on the wedding day, returns to Peter\\'s apartment, knowing that by doing this, she is putting her very life in danger, and says, \"You rescue people everyday. Now it\\'s someone elses turn to rescue you.\" or something along those lines.   Judging by the end, a 3rd intallment is definitly going to be made. So i\\'m looking forward to that.  So hoorah for Spiderman, and hoorah for superhero logic!',\n",
       " 'I have some very random memories from a long long time ago, that I distinctly remember for no reason.  The first one that came to mind just now was sitting in Mrs. Perry\\'s class in the 1st grade. I made a little drawing of my head, with two stick hands tearing out the hair, and above it I wrote, \"I hate school!\". Why I hated school, I do not know. I turned to the kid on my right, and showed him the little drawing. He looked very upset, and proceeded to show the teacher what I had done, and she was angry.  Another memory from the same grade. I was out on the playground, going forward and backward and forward and backward on one of those animal things on the big spring. I think this time it was a duck. I obviously had other things on my mind because everybody else had already gone back to class, and I didn\\'t notice a thing. They sent someone out to get me after awhile.  I also distinctly remember playing by myself alot. Not all the time, just sometimes, and I would go to this cage of bars type thing, and pretend it was sometype of arena, and lizard people with swords would fight me, and I would kick their asses, and then escape. I did that alot. And then, this one time, a kid came up to me, and asked if he could play too. I couldn\\'t imagine how it would work with more people then me, and, not to my surprise, it didn\\'t work at all.  Another memory. The school was in my neighborhood, in easy walking distance from my house, so I walked home every day. Once I couldn\\'t see the school anymore I would start running, scared to death, because I always thought someone was going to chase me and grab me. I was very paranoid.  So, later on in the middle of the school year I switched schools, for reasons I don\\'t remember. I remember my first day there, and I was rather upset from the change. When all the other kids walked in I distinctly remember making fun of each of them in my mind, deciding right then and there that I would never be friends with them.  And this one time, on St. Patrick\\'s day. While we went away for lunch or something like that, the principle and some other people took the time to create flour foot prints into our class, carefully turn all the desks on their sides, and upside down, and all disorganised, and left footprints leading out and down the hall. When we returned one of the girls in my class began to cry, because leprechauns had vandalised our beautiful classroom. So we followed the footprints, wearing our trusty green shaded leprechaun vision goggles, and found the little bastard in the office. A stuffed leprechaun doll. We then took him back to the class and stuck him in our pre-made tissue box leprechaun traps, to starve and rot and suffer in his guilt. *cough*  Not exactly the most pleasant memories.

       " 'Devon used to be a fairly athletic guy, always running around, doing sports. He wasn\\'t the best, but, he definitely wasn\\'t the worst. But in time, he matured and became somewhat of a nerd. He was always on his computer, his brother gave it to him once he moved out and got a better one, so it wasn\\'t a great computer. His friends, few friends, described it as \\'ancient.\\' His life wasn\\'t all that boring until one day...so he thought.  Devon was at his little computer, typing away for a research project for his college history class. He was writing a 10 page essay over the Revolutionary War. It was due tomorrow  and he was only on the 7th page. To make matters worse, he was really stressing out and when he looked at the clock it read: 2:16 AM.  \"Crap, why did I wait so long to do this! Prof. Neits assigned it a week ago, and I blew it off until three days before.\" He sighed. He finished the sentence he was typing and leaned back in his comfy chair, his only escape from the major pressure, with his arms behind his head. The screen flashed black then a greenish blue screen popped up.   \"Oh my God! What happened to my report!!\" he screamed as he slapped the computer hoping it might help.  It flashed white then blue again and typed out the message:  \"m-th-r k-dn-pp-d. -ddr-ss = time, r-ck p-th.\"  \"What is that supposed to mean? It\\'s in some sort of code, or something...Wait a minute, there aren\\'t any vowels! Except in time. I wonder why..\" Devon questioned. \"Hmm...maybe the dashes took place of certain vowels?? M-_-T-H-_-R..Hmmm, M-A, nah. M-E? nope...M-I!...no..M-O! M-O-T-H-E-R...Mother?! What about her!!\" He screamed, as if it were a living person.  Devon spent hours, it seemed, trying to crack the rest of the message. So far he had Mother kidnapped. Address = time rock path. He still was unsure what the time was for. Eventually, the remembered it was 2:16 when this message came up.  \"216 Rock Path? That\\'s not an address anywhere near here.\" wondered Devon. \"What addresses do I know of that have a 216 in their address..\"  After about 10 minutes of thinking, he finally had it.  \"216 Rock Path stands for 216 Stoney Road! It\\'s only a few blocks from here!\" he shouted \"But why would my mom be at the library? Oh well, I better go look for her.\"  For some unknown reason, he got up, tossed his bag over his shoulder, and headed out the door.  \"What the-!\" exclaimed Devon as he peered around outside. It was daylight. \"How is this possible?! My computer said 2:16!\"  He decided it didn\\'t matter seeing as he had to get to his mother\\'s aid. Then, he realized that his mom was here, in New York. When she lived in Kansas.  \"Wait a minute. How can she be here?\" asked Devon, as if there was some all-knowing guru right next to him. \"No time though, I must get to her.\"  He trekked on and eventually reached the library. It seemed to be standing unusually taller than normal but he ignored it.  \"216 Stoney Road. This is it\" he said. As he walked into the library.   There was a spiral staircase. He walked up to it, looked upwards, only to see it going up very high. Too high He saw the ceiling and figured his mother might be there seeing as she wasn\\'t on the first floor. He started hiking up the staircase getting nearer to the ceiling, and to his mom. He was looking up the whole time but, when he looked down, he appeared to be on the third step still. This threw his equilibruim off and he stumbled. But, the ceiling wasn\\'t any further away than when it was a second ago. He got up and started up the stairs once again. After hours, it seemed, he finally go to the top. He peered over the edge of the floor and saw his mother tied to a chair at the end of a hallway of bookcases. He hurried up the rest of the way and dashed to his mother. As he neared her, her heard her screaming something.  \"G-- -p!!! W-k- u- D---n!!\" she screamed.  Slowly, the message became clear. She was screaming \\'Get up! Wake up Devon!\\' Devon, realizing he was in a dream, he suddenly awoke to find himself in his room. But, it wasn\\'t his room as it had been in the dream. Not his sheetless bed, cluttered desk and shelves. But, it was his twin bed, with dinosaur sheets and pillow, his rug with a street and town imprinted on it. The rug had toys scattered everywhere on it.  \"Devon! Get up! It\\'s time for school!!\"',\n",
       " '\"LANCE! WAKE UP! NOW!!\" A large man with a deep voice was banging on the door to Lance\\'s bedroom.  It was six o\\'clock in the morning, and Lance rolled over with a sigh.  He opened his eyes to look at his clock.  \"Ugh, I hate this... especially on a Monday...\" he shut his eyes and went back to sleep.    Twenty minutes later Lance\\'s father came into the room, dressed for work in a black business suit and a tie.  \"Lance,\" he started \"It looks like I\\'ll have to get you out of bed again.\" he walked over to the side of the bed and pulled back Lance\\'s warm covers.  Lance\\'s legs shot up to his chest the moment the cold morning air touched him; he shivered a little.  His dad then lifted the matress off on one side, sending Lance rolling over onto the floor with a thud.  \"DAD! I told you not to do that anymore!\" he said, shooting up.  His dad replied with a small devlish smile on his face, \"maybe next time I should pour cold water on your head instead?\"  Lance shouted back \"NO!  Come on dad, I\\'m never late for school.\" \"Only because I get you up.\" his dad replied.  Two minutes later they left the house, Lance was chewing on a cereal bar and trying to flatten his messy brown hair which he had no time to comb.  \"Got everything?\" his dad asked.  \"Yeah, everything except a good night\\'s sleep.\" Lance said with a small yawn.  He saw his dad get into his car and drive off to work.  Lance lived in a small community just outside of the city, so his house just across the street from school.    In Twenty minutes the first period bell rang.  Lance was practially falling asleep, he stayed up too late doing homework, only because he chatted over AIM too long.  His dad didn\\'t get home until very late, so it\\'s not like his dad would really care on the way home from work.  First period was Geometry, and he wondered why this class had to be first period of the day.  \"Class.\" a blonde haired teacher addresed the class, \"pull out your homework.  Problems 1-65 please.\" Lance\\'s heart sank... he didn\\'t do his homework!  \"Oh, what am I going to tell hi-\" he stopped mid-thought, walking across the room, her blonde hair flowing in the air behind her, was Alexa. She walked past the window which overlooked the flowers in front of the school, her glowing blue eyes flashed in Lance\\'s direction, and for a moment, both eyes met, and the-  \"Looking at the beauty of God\\'s work, Lance?\" the teacher asked. \"Uh, y-y-yes, sir.  I mean, no sir, I mean-\" Lance replied, wondered if the teacher saw him looking at Alexa. The teacher replied sarcastically \"I know how beautiful the flowers in the garden are, but please try and pay attention.  Now, you\\'re homework?\"  The last bell rang, and Lance picked up his bag and headed for his locker. Behind him walked Alexa and some of her friends.  He wondered if he\\'d ever get to make a move, she was always hanging around with her friends, and it\\'s not like he could just pull up in some nice expensive car and drive away alone with her, impressing both Alexa and her friends.  He headed outside, going home, but stopped at a tree to think.  After banging his head against the tree several times, he saw Alexa come out for tennis practice.  Several rounds went by, when all of a sudden a voice popped up from behind Lance.  \"Painful, isn\\'t it.  You\\'re whole world standing just beyond that fence, just out of reach.\"  Lance seemed not to notice too much \"it\\'s only a fence...\" he replied back.  The guy behind him answered that, \"a very big fence, can\\'t have stray tennis balls flying out... or flying in for that matter.\"  \"No.. we wouldn\\'t want tha-  HEY!\" Lance jumped back.  Standing behind him was a shrimpy kid with red hair and brown eyes, he was obviously a freshman.  \"What are you sneaking up on people for?\"  After several minutes of talking, Lance really only found out the guys name was Mike, and he skipped all of middle school because of his intelligence, but knew how he could help Lance get Alexa.  \"Um, but if you skipped all of middle school... wouldn\\'t that mean, you know... you\\'re a nerd?  And uh, incapeable of getting a date?\"  Mike looked stunned, \"well, if you don\\'t want my help, you\\'re doing a greeeeaaat job already with getting your date.  So I\\'ll be out of your way.\"  as Mike walked away, Lance realized how good off he WASN\\'T in getting Alexa.    The next day after school, Lance was in his position.  Mike had reset the electronic message board in front of the school to read \"ALEXA, I LOVE YOU\", and then Mike would set off some fireworks or something.  Lance could care less about fireworks, he just wanted the message to be seen.  Alexa would soon come out from tennis practice, but one of the last ones to leave so all of her friends wouldn\\'t be there.  He waited, and waited, and waited.  Until at last, after what seemed like an hour (but was really only five minutes) Lance got up the courage to go find her himself.  He walked around the corner, only to see Alexa making out with some other guy!  How could this happen?!   Lance quickly tured around and headed home.  Moments later he heard the fireworks go off, so he suspected that Mike sent them off, and also wondered if he turned on the sign.  If Mike DID turn on the sign, it was probably in the other guy\\'s favor.  He gave a big sigh as he fell backwards onto his bead.  \"Oh well, life moves on I guess.\" he said to himself.  \"but I really did like her...\"',\n",

       " '\"Dimitri! Wake up!\" yelled Drew, one of Dimitri\\'s crew buddies.  \"Huh? Aaaaaah!\" screamed Dimitri, still thinking he was falling toward the deep turquoise waters of the ocean.   \"Whoah buddy, calm down, you are safe inside the ship on a nice cot now, don\\'t worry\" reassured Winters.   \"Ouch! Ughh...what h-happened? Where am i-I?\" mumbled Dimitri as he flinched the moment he felt a shock of pain run through his battered leg.  \"You were hanging on the anchor after being hit by that cannon ball. You fainted, but, you still hung on. You saved my life.\" said Winters. Dimitri noticed the faintest trace of sympathy within his gaze. \"Thank you. And, thank God we managed to get you up. Drew here had to go down there with a rope around his waist. He carried you up to safety!\"   \"Heh, th-thanks Drew. But, d-did we win the battle?\" said Dimitri, shivering from loss of blood.  \"Yes we did. It was a close one though. They got us pretty badly. I have some of the crew working on those dents below deck. It\\'s a good thing we built her sturdy!\" chuckled Winters.  As Dimitri looked around the room from the soft cot they had lain him on, he saw Drew, Winters and a few other crew mates he sometimes talked to including Jake, Gavin, and Hector. He started to smile, knowing that all these people were here because they cared for him, just as everything started spinning and became fuzzy, he blacked out yet again.  His peaceful sleep was broken by another dream. It started just as the other one ended.   It was a trap...',\n",
       " 'Dimitri hung from the anchor hole as best he could, the shock still held him in its numbing grip. He could see Cptn. Winters yelling, but the noise was shier void, as if audio has seized. Dimitri held fast for a time into the battle, but has only the strength of a man, and finally his grip faltered, and he plunged into the turquoise water.      The following few minutes were a total blur of blue and white foam, but by a godsend chance, he ended up on a plank, 100 or more yards out, it was all he could do to hold to the board as he drifted farther, and again, passed into darkness...     Again awaken, this time, to the lumbering shadow of a Royal Battle Ship. Then he noticed a life raft headed in his direction, with fully armored gaurdsmen ready to escourt him to the abyss. He made a feble attempt to flee, but it was only an aimless paddle outward, and he soon stood before the Admiral of the Royal Navy Fleet.     It was a trap...',\n",
       " 'His happy thought was soon interrupted by a loud *CRACK*. Across the room, there was a large, splintered dent in the hull of the ship. He jumped, dropping Wesley to the floor. Wesley hurriedly scurried off to his same little cove in the flour, but, Dimitri had nowhere to go.  \"We are surrounded!\" said a crew member, shortly followed my another loud crack directly behind Dimitri. He was thrown forward by the sheer force of the blow to the hull. Dimitri decided to run up on deck to see what the heck was happening.  When he saw Winters standing there, calm and fierce, at the same time, he too was clam for a second. A very short second. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a huge steel ball flying through the air straight for the captain\\'s back.  \"CAPTAIN! WATCH OUT!\" scream Dimitri as he dove to protect the captain. The ball thankfully misses Winters, but, Dimitri wasn\\'t so lucky. The cannon ball had bashed his right leg from the knee down to no return. It\\'s force carried Dimitri, away from the captain toward the edge of the deck. He fell down the side of the ship. The captain was sure, he would never see that young, intellegent Dimitri again.  He slowly walked to the edge of the ship to see the fate of his young hero. Everything around him seemed to go in slow motion as he peered over the edge to see young Dimitri hanging from the anchor hole.',\n",
       " 'He walked carefully accross the slightly flour covered floor, taking special care of where he placed each foot. Upon reaching the wall he slid down onto the floor, his knees bent into his stomach. He surveyed the floor around him, looking for something. His face lit up at the sight of his partner. A large fat, grey haired rat, was laying, almost squished, between two bags of flour. Dimitri greeted his furry companion, and gave him a little scratch on the nose. \"Hello there, Wesley.\" The rat instantly began grinding it\\'s teeth, making the clicking noise all rats make when overjoyed.  Dimitri reached into his vest pocket, and pulled out a shimmering gold coin. The rat\\'s eyes burst with joy at the sight of it. It began scraping away at the floor with it\\'s paws, slowly, but surely pulling itself out of it\\'s little cave. (How it got in there in the first place, is another mystery of the universe.) Then, like a bullet out of a rifle, Wesley the Rat came rocketing out of his hole. His head slammed into Dimitri\\'s outstreched hand, and bounced back. Taking a second to regain his thoughts, he than grabbed the coin in his paws, gave it a snif, and than a bite. He looked up once more at Dimitri\\'s face, to show his gratification, and scampered off, down a hole in the floor.   Wesley returned from his home in the floor, skipping greetings and immediatley searching Dimitri\\'s hands for another shiny prize. Dimitri handed about 20 coins to the large greedy rat, untill he came back to an empty hand. Dimitri patted him on the head, and scratched him behind the ears, and said, \"Don\\'t worry Wes, I\\'ll bring you more another day.\"  Dimitri had been practicing this ritual for quite awhile now. He\\'s probably stored atleast 300 coins down there. Dimitri smiled to himself. He picked up Wesley and cradled him in his arms, tickling his white belly.   From above, a loud commotion broke out. Dimitri sat nervously, petting the rat to sooth his fear. He\\'d been through this many times, but it always worried him. The panic in his mind has calmed down a little since his first time in an attack, but never completely. To erase the fear completely would be to erase the human in him, it is impossible. The yelling got louder, Dimitri became more uneasy. He imagined the fight taking place above him. He saw the enemy ship, 4 times as large as his own. He saw a cannonball lodge itself in the side of the ship, and the entire room filling with water. He then saw Captian Winters, fighting to his very last breath, and suddenly, remarkably, most of his worry was soothed. He pictured him and Winters, fighting together, side by side. He smiled to himself again, and waited.',\n",
       " 'After seeing the captain\\'s steady gaze, he calmly went back to his room to read. He was reading a very good book. It was an action scene, much like the one he was experiencing at this very moment. The only variation was that it wasn\\'t between two pirate vessels. It was between two small countries a ways south and east of where they were. It was a fiction book so, it never  really  happened. But, it was really interesting. So interesting, he didn\\'t even notice the captain standing in the doorway, giving him that same, comforting, yet forceful green stare.  \"We are approaching the enemy ship.\" explained Winters. \"We are just out of firing range so I need you to take cover below deck, on the starboard side.\"  \"Yes sir.\" said Dimitri as he snapped his book shut and stood up straight.  The captain then turned on his heel, and walked, almost marching, down below deck with Dimitri following. Once below the upper deck, Dimitri once again saw this familiar place. Barrels of ale, bags of curry and flower. There was a different arrangement in the corner with some flower bags. One could tell that Dimitri has been here before and these small battles are no new thing. Little did he know, this was not any ordinary \\'small battle.\\'',\n",
       " 'It still amazed Dimitri how organized the crew was. Drunken fools only hours before, they now worked with an ease and grace like no other. Another mystery of the universe, thought Dimitri. Perhaps though, it wasn\\'t all that much of a mystery at all. Dimitri glanced at the captian, and they caught eachothers eyes, and for a split second, Dimitri knew exactly why the Pirates worked so well. The sharp green eyes smiled at Dimitri, and seemed to tell him, \"Everything will be alright.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sir! You must awaken! The pirateship Sailbeam has been spotted only half a mile out!\" Fumbiling about for his trousers and coat, the news is delivered quickly. \"The Captain requests your prescence on the bridge, sir!\" Out of the cabin, it was utter pandamonium, men hurried for their cloths and ran to their battle stations, some half nude.    Once on the bridge, he realized that only half the officers were in uniform. \"How long till were in range?\" asked Captain Winters. \"Twenty minuets, if the winds hold\", said the navigator  \"What are we up against?\", the Captain asked  \"Armorment unknown,\" said the weapons specalist,\" but our range isn\\'t enough to strike first\" Dimitri sighed, this was the kind of thing right out of the text book, but he still worried. Would this day end for him at the bottom of the sea?',\n",

       " \"In the warm lamplight Dimitri fumbled dizzily around the swaying, creaking, snoring room. Dimly lit all around him were the faces and beards of stinky old men, half asleep, half unconcious. The smell of ale wafted steadily in front of Dimitri's nose, poisoning his every breath. He carefully made his way through a maze of bodies, trying hard not to step on anyone, and then halted in the corner, shining his lamp on a large chest nested next to the wall, bolted to the floor. He exhales, sending dust in swirling patterns in front of his eyes. His attention is temporarily lost in the swirling patterns of light rays through dust. Quickly he snaps back into reality, and reaches into his pocket. His hand emerges from the pocket of his sleeveless white vest, revealing a rather large, rusty key. Hey presses the key into it's rightful hole on the chest, and turns it. Quickly but carefully he opens the large metal framed lid of the chest, and the light from his lamp is reflected back at him, from thousands of golden coins. Hastily, he shuffles a couple handfuls of coins into a small bag, closes the lid, locks the chest, and creeps back through the maze of smelly old men. He climbs up a ladder, breathes a sigh of releif, and retreats to his cabin.   The creaking of the ship continues steadily as Dimitri lay on his back, staring up at the ceiling of his private room. He closes his eyes and has a short moment of peace. Sadly to be soon interupted by tomorrow's duties.\",\n",

As a nasty side effect of loosing all my files, my music collection has been clipped some 200 and some odd files. 300 and some I had previously backed up to disk. Yesterday I was barely able to reinstall WinXP Pro and get back online, while I currently wait for my sister's roommate to drop me an email with instrucions on how to get the new hard drive in the right way.  My first exam starts in four days. Judging from the review the past week in class, I think I'll do farely well. Also, only 16 more days till my GameCube. Walmart is currently offering a deal where when you purchase a GameCube you receive a free 5 game demo disc; I hope this offer is available in my area.

Thanks graciously to the very skilled people in #windows95 on DALnet, I was able to sort out my problems and have my new 40gig drive up and running as a slave drive. I would have liked to get it as master and move my files over to it, using my old 8gig for music stoarge, but one thing at a time.  I just finshed writing my English exams just over 40 minutes ago, I think I actually did well. Considering how much I choked on my science on tuesday, I hope to woo my parents with a uplifted enlish mark to help secure my Game Cube.   Speaking of which, only 10 more days till I get it. I've been doing some handiwork here and there lately, so I'm happy to have nearly enough money to buy the Matrix Reloaded when I do get the Game Cube. First things first though, Windwaker has to be beaten. And for that to happen i'll be needing a memory card so I guess I'll have to dip into my matrix money.

       " \"Oh bother, I just remembered something; I forgot to announce to the masses that I completed Wind Waker. Well not so much as completed, as I did finish the main quest. Kudos to sreid for navigating the last stretch before I took a break from packing to deliver the end blow.   The finishing cinematics are really something, much better then Orcarina of Time or Manjora's Mask, and the fact that you start a new quest after first beating the game. Nothing amazingly new in the second quest, mostly just change of clothing for characters, start of with the delux pictograph, and you gain the ability to read Hylian, but a nice little addon none the less. So all thats left now is the collection of side quest items, heart pieces and whatnot, and it will be another Zelda game behind me. I shant think I'll grow as bored with this one quite as quickly I did the others, the game is simply to large.  One peeve however is seems to lack the number of enjoyable minigames that were tucked in with previous Zelda versions. Wind Waker does feature serveral games in it, but none as addictive as ones in Orcarina of Time and the dark world shooting gallery in Link to the Past. What the game lacks in mini games it more then makes up for in side quests to keep the player content and involved with the game, which is always nice to see.  Now as Wind Waker fades into memory a new choice is presented: Enter the Matrix... yes or no. A month ago I would have clubbed myself like a baby seal if I would have considered no as an option, but after rewatching the Metriod Prime movie clips on the bonus disc, and checking out other games now out for the GameCube, I'm starting to question if I really feel like completeing a game with the style and size of Enter the Matrix. By the end of this week I'll have enough money to purchase it, so I supose the descision will be made then.  Thats about it I supose; as it will be a very boring and uneventful night as most of the chatters have gone to the grad party. *sigh* whats a poor nerd to do? Eat, yes eat.

Nuts to your blinces, I'm going to bed.\",\n",
       " \"Ooo, look at me! I'm Mr. Happy Man, I like to make people happy! And I live on a gum drop house on loly-pop laaaane!  No, not really. Actually im exhausted; 8 hours of Wind Waker will do that to a person. I swear the thing has a center of pure heroin wrapped in a delicious chocolate coating. Its addictive and I need help. Please, for the love of god save me from my wonderful new toy. Oh well, a fool and his gamecube are soon parted, and rightfully so. A three day break from the magical black box tomorrow for my cousins graduation and some visiting, then back home friday night for grading day marks the next day. Enough about me though, hows things with you? Dog still alive? Kids still not getting the fuck of your lawn? Yeah I know, same ol same ol.  ...but what aboot second breakfast?\",\n",
       " 'Whoa buddy, lets settle it down there scholars. No, no lets not.  Friday night I had to work, just moving and setting up sound equipment. No big deal but I didnt get home till 4 in the morning so I\\'m still exhausted, 4 and a half hours sleep tends to do that to you, but money is money, and I\\'m glad I had it. I say had because yesterday I got a pleasent little surprise when I got my gamecube a week early. Unfortunatly the save card and players guide for Wind Waker came to 52 bucks, so my money left me as quickly as it came.  Now for my official game review deal.  Anything bad said about the graphic style of Zelda Wind Waker can go burn itself. The new cell shaded style the producer implemented fits perfectly for the game, in addition to the sound, which is also phenominal. Im not even a forth of the way through the mian quest and I can tell already the development team really went all out for detail and game immersion. The environments are massive, and completly interactive while the AI is far more diverse then previous games. Another improvement is player control, adding the ability to crouch and crawl, along with \"sidle\" along narow ledges. Swordplay is also more advanced, more varying attack combinations make for more energetic fight scenes.  I could go on but there is so much more ot the game then I feel like typing out. I highly recomend everyone with a gamecube to go out and buy this game. Those without gamecubes should buy one just for the fact of getting this game. This game gets my personal best of 10 thumbs up, along with super fantastico rocking my face award.  ...Seek... help.',\n",

Grammatical error or not, I still hate the idea of them like a fat kid hates celery.  Now living in a time where even Joe Shmoe can post his ideas and thoughts to the world via such resources as the internet, I think the idea of raising a few such blogs into the spotlight to be shown as more important or more relivant then others is remarkably stupid. Who are a few such clones to deem that one persons life be more wrothy then an others, or claim that since one blogger says something a little differently, covers things a little diffently, or lives life a little differently, that it is a amazing development.  And maybe I\\'m wrong, maybe I myself am over-emphasizing, but the fact remains that there is nothing more special about one blog then another. Well, besides this one, but thats heartless spam of course. Just felt like getting it off my chest. Maybe if I can get some traffic and actually post some content that the masses deem entertaining I\\'ll gain the goody goody gosh status of being on the front page with 8 other \"Blog of Note\".

       " \"Didn't blog lately, because frankly, nothin happened. sreid got his NBA Street Volume 2 which inheirently rocks our faces, and we've been trying to school each other in that the past few days. Breagh came over today, so I've been in a pretty good mood since.  Me and sreid decided to walk to town today and see what was good at the theatres. We made it in there in about an hour and a half, which we thought was a pretty good time. Bought tickets to see The Hulk but then changed our minds and opted for Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. It was a good action movie all and all. Lots of explosions, hot chick, all the good stuff. The only downside was certain plot twists where you really had to understand the first two movies or have been following along intentivly to really understand it.   Anyway that was cool and I got home round ten to twelve and decided to browse a little before I get some much needed sleep, lord knows I need it after the walk to the movies. Fuck fuck mother mother fuck its warm in here, another nights above the blankets I supose. It is summer but I hate when I end up kicking the sheets off halfway through the night only to be woken up an hour later when the temperature drops and try and remake my bed while in it.   Incase you didn't notice (which the few of you who read the blog probably did't), I added a hit counter at the top of the page to keep track of how many people I've actually managed to woo to my site. I just stuck it up there for now until I do a remake of the blog layout and find a better spot to put it.

Right now however it's 1:38am and I don't have the slightest of energy to start redoing a blog template. Not to mention I have to be up to mow grass tomorrow and spend no doubt several hours infront of the GameCube playing sreid's yet to be aquired NBA Street Volume 2.

       " 'One of the better Mondays I\\'ve had in quite a while. The morning was spent idling somewhat bordishly (if that IS even a word) on the net, then after lunch me and sreid headed to his house to burn some music. A few hours later my music collection goes from 450 to almost 1100 songs now. Oh but shhh, dont let the RIAA find out. While burning he and I set about completing more of his recently aquired Mario Sunshine for his new GameCube, and when burning completed we opted for a trip to subway where I selfishly delved into my Matrix money to keep my stomach content. We tried renting NBA Street Volume from the video store, but aparently there was a lock on his name, so we eventually ended in town and him getting 007 Agent Under Fire for his grading gift, or was his birthday gift, I dont know.  The game plays well and there are plenty of options to customize gameplay. We only played the multiplayer mode, but I expect the missions to be weel constructed too. I was glad to see the presence of AI bots in multiplayer mode, it really helps boost game value when you want to play a little skrimich but dont want to have to rely on a second human player for an opponent. I\\'ll cut my review short there as I\\'m in the mood for a rant, bare with me.  If any of you little people out there reading this are also bloggers, and have browsed the random blog list on the main page of blogger.com, you have no doubt seen the Blogs Of Interest blogs listed there. Now correct me if I\\'m wrong, but when I see a list of blogs titled \"Blogs Of Interest\", one would come to the reasonable conclusion that these blogs would be interesting; they would be different, they would be something that I could enjoy to read each time they\\'re updated. They lie! Now I\\'m not saying my blog should be put on this list, I\\'m not jealous or any close proximity by any sence, but I see nothing extra special about the serveral blogs I have looked over in the list. Call me a ass for thinking so, but I really think whoever decided these blogs were special, has some creativity issues.  Now I dont know if there is supose to be any certain honor amongst bloggers or what have you, but I feel like I have the right assigned to me by the wonderful freedom of speech to lay a royal smackdown on Matrix Essays in particular. I myself am a huge fan of the matrix, seen the movies, quote the lines regularly, bend spoons and dodge bullets on occation, but this blog, is uber poopoo. Thats right, Ive had to lower myself to the level of calling things \"uber poopoo\" to describe this blog. I\\'ve thought about the ideas the matrix represents, the messages it can convey under the actual screenplay, and the intellectual stimulus it can provide if really thought out, but this site takes it way too far. Explaining unforseen events by reasonable doubt is fine, but I think people who take the Matrix and bend it into the bloody bible of their life is truely pathetic in my views.  I didnt see anyone taking a copy of Ace Ventura and study it trying to derive connections to every possible segment of religion, humanity, and social issues. I know the movies have little to no similiarities, but thats what they still remain to be, movies. The matrix is a freaking movie, not some blasted 8th wonder of the world. It doesnt hold the meaning of life, a prophacy of things to come, or the Carmilk secret. Its a entertainment medium, end of story. Stop trying to pick it apart and guess what each and every frame of the movie conveys, and enjoy it for what it is, a well writen and well directed peice of flim. Neos, Trinitys, Morpheus\\', Oracles of the net, do me and many other people a favor:  Shut the fuck up.',\n",

But I mean, hey its a lazy Sunday night, so what else is there to do for those of us with no life. Thats right, twiddle our thumbs and hum hillbilly tunes to our keyboard.  Alright I could have sworn I mentioned in my last blog that I was going to the beach today, but I guess not. So I caught a little sand and surf. Well actually I caught alot of sun, and now the burn on my back prooves it. I'll be a nice brown by tomorrow, but I ended heading for the water before I roasted the front side of me, so I guess I'll be tan on one side, albino on the other. Dam sunbruns sure do make you thirsty.  Still no decission on Enter the Matrix yet, but I'm leaning towards it right now. I just wanna figure out if the two disks are for seperate missions or just one long continuous gameplay. I'm hoping each disk represents a character. Ive played as the man, but I want to see how or if Niobe is any different. I've seen the previews so I know you get to play as her on atleast on mission, but the possibility of two different story lines you could follow is just a hope I dont want to let go of.

It was long, which was good, but too much of it seemed like useless story line trying to explain things. Despite bad reviews due to CG, the hulk himself seemed very natural. The action sequences in the movie were well done and I'm glad to say the acting wasn't as terrible as I thought it might be.  Breagh came over today, it was a great time, after some stuff the las tfew days the visit really helped things.

Just got my local home phone changed to B\\u2026 cos man it\\u2019s DAMN cheap\\u2026 yep, I reckon it is\\u2026 cos it\\u2019s only $29.95 for line rental, (which is cheaper than ANY OPTUS or TELSTRA LINE! \\u2013 both above $33) and not only is it $29.95\\u2026 it includes 100 local phone calls!!! \\u2013 we only make like around 70 or 80 per month so we never have to pay more than $29.95. much cheaper than what we pay which we used to pay (which was $33 for line rental no free calls, and then pay like up to $15 just for local calls, and then we make like an extra $15, for Mobile + STD, for international we make a local call and use a calling card which is even cheaper\\u2026)  SO! - $29.95 and that\\u2019s all why? \\u2013 cos I changed ISP to iiNet. Cost only $79.95 per month, but I get $10 off, per month cos I also joined their iiPhone, which means I only pay $69.95 for like 32gb download, which I seriously doubt I\\u2019ll ever have to worry about going over, if I don\\u2019t plan to download crap loads of stuff. And it\\u2019s a 512/128 connection 32gb, for less than $70\\u2026 then iiPhone, there are no monthly fees or anything, it just for mobile, international and STD calls, (we\\u2019ll never use the international calls) but as for the STD and mobile calls, they have the cheapest rates out of all the providers I have ever seen, SO that means we\\u2019ll lover that $15 to mobiles to maybe 10\\u2026 so if I add up everything that\\u2019s only $100 per month for all phone and internet! \\u2013 which is a much better Deal than our current $160 per month deal\\u2026 so yeah, all is good =) save parents $60 per month. And we\\u2019ll get to use the phone more and not pay as much.  Okay\\u2026 not that you needed to know all that crap! \\u2013 but man that took me ages\\u2026 1 \\xbd hours to get done\\u2026 and well 328 words to type what I did =S. I spent like some time yesterday night to check out mobile plans, and then ended up with home phone plans, and I also came across the net plan SO I just got everything changed the next day. No rash decision, all figured out, been thinking about the net thing for ages.  Mobile plans\\u2026 why was I checking them out? \\u2013 well, supposedly my family\\u2019s gonna have a ABN number\\u2026 meaning I can sign up for business plans\\u2026 and the thing is business mobile plans have the CHEAPEST imaginable rates\\u2026 so yeah, it\\u2019ll be good, only down side of things is that they don\\u2019t offer Yes time\\u2026 which I guess right now isn\\u2019t such a  BIG deal, cos I\\u2019ll just get people to call me, But then again, I don\\u2019t use Yes time THAT often so with what I save if I wanted to phone someone even without yes time it would be worth while. BUT my contract only ends like next year\\u2026 and well I plan to by a new phone in SG or Malaysia end of year\\u2026 so yeahz. I\\u2019ll see what happens\\u2026 still got heaps of time.   (man what is this guy talking about yeah??? \\u2013 weirdest blog entry ever right? \\u2013 hmmm maybe\\u2026 )  Anyway! How was my day? \\u2013 Good, cos I feel better =) but still not perfect, I actually was running late for the train on the way home, cos I wanted to go somewhere before home, so I jogged a bit, and got my heart rate maybe up 10 bpm, and well I could feel that even if I wanted to run 100m tomorrow, there was no chance I would make it to the finish line ALIVE! If I tired\\u2026 cos I think it was like the virus that could attack the heart, and well I could already feel that it wasn\\u2019t good. BUT if I didn\\u2019t run, I think today, was the best I\\u2019ve felt in like 2 weeks.  Spesh first period, man been awhile since I\\u2019ve had spesh\\u2026 I\\u2019m so far behind, David Oh, the ultimate genius of Maths\\u2026 is like Kenny\\u2026 you\\u2019ve done nearly nothing this year\\u2026 no exercises no home work\\u2026 if you tired Kenny you would do so much better, (well I guess who would yeah?). in some sense to me that\\u2019s a huge encouragement, cos the fact is, right now I\\u2019m doing spesh unlike anyone else, but yet, man I\\u2019m KICKING like 80% of the people at BHHS!!! Now that is HILLARIOUS! \\u2013 I feel like one of those people who everyone hates\\u2026 never do any work\\u2026 but still can do so well =P hahahz! YES! \\u2013 man how good does that feel, but yeah I think in the long term, esp when everyone revises at the end of the year, I\\u2019m sure to fall behind.  Okay, Maths was my BEST subject by far when I was younger\\u2026 I ACED maths up to year 9 =S then well, hmmm people got better than me, and I just got used to it. So now I don\\u2019t care =S Cos it\\u2019s DAVID OH, man how can you beat someone who get perfect mark, even if you tired, you can only equal him, and what the guy don\\u2019t even do half the set work\\u2026 but me =S I do maybe a tenth =S probably less... hmmm I guess what I\\u2019m trying to say is that I\\u2019m still no over this mental battle to figure out whether I\\u2019m dumb, or that I have a brain. (not literally). It\\u2019s not good to admit you have one, and well that\\u2019s what I\\u2019ve refused to do for many years already, making myself believe I\\u2019m dumb, so it\\u2019s okay to not do well, (my excuse), but then hmmm if I tired, I guess I could do better, and currently, if I tired I don\\u2019t know what the possibilities could me. Maybe I could do really well at spesh? Which is kinda important\\u2026 sighz, I don\\u2019t know, maybe I\\u2019m scared that if I try and I don\\u2019t do that well that I feel that I\\u2019m stupid, cos well without trying I\\u2019m doing =S alright, but it\\u2019s not something to commend\\u2026 cos it\\u2019s pretty dodgy, since it\\u2019s no where near an A+\\u2026 just cos everyone fails\\u2026 I guess I can\\u2019t compare to them\\u2026 well not can\\u2019t I shouldn\\u2019t. I should have higher standards\\u2026 but yeah, doesn\\u2019t it feel good to feel that you kicked people\\u2019s bums?...  Hmmm, what I seriously wonder about is all the people who are like thinking\\u2026 what? Kenny kick people\\u2019s bums, and he didn\\u2019t even do anything\\u2026 BHHS must be full of the biggest retards\\u2026 Well that\\u2019s where you\\u2019re wrong, BHHS got tons of smart people, the school overall does A LOT better than average, and well is one of the schools with the highest percentage of people who get about 90 as an ENTER.  Okay, I\\u2019m just gonna shut up now\\u2026 I just need to study and do spesh for once\\u2026 but in my head I keep thinking, if I don\\u2019t try, I can\\u2019t be blamed for getting a crap mark.  Ha\\u2026 man I write so much crap that, because of this, I\\u2019ve decided to open a new blog, and stick all this crap into there\\u2026 I need to maintain a decently level of quality of saneness in my proper blog.

I have been, in the words of one of my \\'friends\\' (you\\'ll see why I use inverted commas later) a jumped up backstabbing dick. I think this email, sent to me after a pathetic dispute over... well the email explains all:   Dear Richard   You may be correct, it may be us that owe you an apology, and i am sure that we were all prepared to talk about this like sensible adults. However, you may think that you are being mature by sending around an email telling us that we are pathetic, but for once could you maybe take a step back from your seemingly bottomless pit of knowledge, and the attitude that you always know best, and think to yourself \"Maybe i am the pathetic one?\"   For example how did this whole situation spawn, well i can tell you quite easily, it began when we very kindly invited you to come on our holiday with us in the forthcoming summer, what a nice gesture. Obviously not. Somehow you managed to fabricate the idea in your own mind that we didn\\'t want you there, which we obviously didn\\'t considering that we invited you! You then went on to moan about the cost, location, and company which would also rather piss you off somewhat if anyone else had gone about acting in the same \\'pathetic\\' manner. When asked if you would be attending the trip by myself and Richard you went on to kick a chair, slam a door and then go and tell Adam and Simon that they wern\\'t invited. Very mature. I feel that what you did to them was the biggest backstabbing action which you could have taken, very noble considering that you were supposedly good friends with all of the people on the trip. As you can tell this pissed all of us off just that little bit more, but still i was prepared to hear your side of the story so i came and found you in your history room where YOU found it interesting to bombard Amy and myself with abuse, yet again another honorable action.   Then i attended Science today happy in the knowledge that i would see my good friends Richard and Polly. However, as you may know the mood turned rather sour when you found my very funny joke somewhat unfunny and went about hitting me in the face.(Which i must add was a pathetic punch)   I feel that the trouble with you Richard is that you are somewhat insecure about yourself, your exact words were \"I\\'m not really bothered by what you are saying, it means nothing to me\" if you not bloody bothered then why hit me in the face you idiot if your not bothered then why get in such a shit about everything, why do you make everything worse for yourself squaring up to my best friend storming off in a rage, we are not trying to upset you, it is called a joke if you wern\\'t so pathetic and took it all with a pinch of salt people wouldn\\'t know that it got to you, so wouldn\\'t drill the same old insult, personally your poncy little spack today just made the joke twice as funny, as did it for everybody else in the square after you walked off, hopeing to leave in some sort of dramatic fashion when actually all you did was make yourself look like a complete twat. You wonder why people call you boring, or moody it seems inconceivable to me that you can\\'t see why, this time last week i still thought that you were a genuine decent bloke but you just went and made yourself look like a complete idiot by trying to make somesort of noble stand, resulting, as per usual in everybody else laughing behind your back.   Richard C was right from the very beginning when he told me that you could be a jumped up backstabbing dick, i gave you the benefit of the doubt, but you had to go and shove a number of friendships right up your own ass. Pathetic.   Written by Nik   agreed by Richard    The joke he is refering to by the way, is writing nazi on a photograph of me and drawing a swastika.  I do have to admit he has exagerated these facts ever so slightly, yet it remains me who is the one who needs to apoligise. Considering my actions of the past few days, weeks even, I can see and I do realise that I have behaved in a manner that isn\\'t appropriate, isn\\'t friendly and a manner I simply should not have behaved in. I have apoligised to these people, but I doubt my apoligies will mean much.   I need to consider to myself, what do I want to get from this life? Happiness of course, and if this is what I want, why I am going about it like this, clearly the wrong way. Why am i ruining friendships that took an age to build, with people I actually do get on with, despite thier frequent need for racist comments.

Ukip are a party controlled by a idiot, spun by an American and whose lead candidate in the European elections is a bigoted racist with a permanent sun tan.      To move on from the childish reasons, the Independent on June 16th put it nicely, describing just what leaving the EU means, it  urlLink truly is a \\xa323Bn question . Not only is it sheer lunancy to leave the EU, the largest free trade area in the world and the greatest single benifit to UK interests, the alternatives proposed by Ukip are terrifying to say the least.  They want Britain to leave the European Union, but they are in favour of economic globalisation, and a stronger role for the US dominated World Trade organisation (WTO). The WTO which is already forcing genetically modified US goods into British supermarkets; the WTO that puts global free trade before environmental regulation; the WTO that undermines national laws to push its own economic rules on nation states. While Ukip say they are concerned about independence from Brussels paradoxically they are perfectly prepared to surrender our sovereignty to the WTO and the US.  Similarly Ukip dangle before the electorate the enticing possibility of joining the North American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) to replace the EU, cementing Britain\\u2019s place as the 51st state of America. Unfortunately however this would allow American companies to be free to sue British companies for loss of profits if they tried to impose health and safety or environmental laws that according to NAFTA\\u2019s frankly bizarre definition of free trade discriminates against these companies.  Rather more worryingly, Ukip have almost identical policies to the BNP on migration and asylum; many UKIP parliamentary candidates have been former National Front or Northern League of New Britain Party activists, hence UKIP have been dubbed \"the BNP with smiling faces.\\u201d I only have to point your attention to Robert Kilroy-Silk, who made horrifically stereotypical comments about Arabs describing them all as \\u201csuicide bombers, limb amputators and women repressors.\\u201d  Ukip is an unrealistic political party composed almost entirely of white middle-aged men who seem determined to try and return Britain to an imagined 1950s golden age. It\\'s not going to happen, Britain is stong when in Europe, strong when at the heart of Europe, strong when she can speak alongside her European allies to provide a counter-balance to the lunatic US foreign policy of late.  Recently after Ukip\\'s supposed election breakthrough (15% of the votes from an uninformed and uninterested electorate), they have vowed to \\'wreck\\' the European parliament, so they don\\'t just want to \\'wreck\\' the UK by withdrawing it, they want to ruin the institution that is bringing economic, social and political benifits to the rest of the EU.

I have a company but that doesn\\'t deal in electronics, so I\\'m not using that. I get so frustrated waiting to get the price of some components that\\'s no listed in the normal pricelist. Guess I\\'ll have to use used parts. I\\'ve learnt about BEAM, and thought I\\'d give that a try, because that\\'s just a couple of inverters, transistors, resistors and some caps. I wonder what made Mark Tilden think of this in the first place. Friday today, and I\\'m not quite sure what the night will escalate to. A few beers with some friends, and maybe a trip to the golfcourse. Spent 4 hours there last night. Didn\\'t leave until 12:15am. Getting up at 7:30am to go to work, wasn\\'t a joy. Maybe see what I can get a hold of in used appliances, and take off some components. Need a walkman, or a small tape-player, because the motors in those are better than the ones I got now. I\\'ll have to check a local \"used things\" store. There\\'s a fleamarket tomorrow, maybe I\\'ll find something there. I found the schematics for an EdgeBOT, I don\\'t have a link right here, and I don\\'t remember the name of the author. Perhaps I\\'ll try to build that during the weekend. We\\'ll see.',\n",
       " \"Ozkal answered me and the public today, in the forums at his robotics site. The idea was to play around with the resistor values on the base pin of the transistors. Being careful not to drop below 330Ohm, which would increase the use of voltage. Didn't get any testing done yesterday, because I spent two hours in the kitchen making dinner, and after that I went to the driving range of our golfcourt to hit a few buckets. It good to get some frustration out by hitting a golfball and see it fly 250++ meters. Another soulution to my SimpleBUG problem would be to use gearing, but that's alot of fitting problems, so servo motors would be a good idea. I just checked the lead supplier of model parts around, and one servo costs 114NOK. (That's over $17 USD.) Might have to see if I can find a source for used parts. That's not very easy here in Norway. Hopefully the SimpleBUG will run like crazy tonight.\",\n",
       " \"Another test done last night, and this time it was successful. I got the  urlLink SimpleBUG  working. The motors turned, and almost everything worked out great. The only dissapointing thing was: on the floor, the bug didn't move. When I lifted it off the floor, the motors spun like crazy, on the floor... Nothing. I guess not enough torque in the motors, but the motors are quite powerful. I have sent a message to ozkal, who built the simpleBUG, asking for advice. He's online right now (10:57 GMT+1 08.06.2004), so I hope to get an answer soon. Will post update. I have also started the work on my web-site, and will redesign the whole thing. Articles, images and I hope translated (and maybe new) tutorials will be on the site.\",\n",
       " 'OK. I did a small and simple test this friday, but that wasn\\'t very successfull. I tried building the SimpleBUG robot from ( urlLink endtas.com/robot/ ). I didn\\'t have photodiodes lying around, so I used normal LED\\'s as sensors, and my electronics skills obviously needs work, because it didn\\'t work. The motor turned, but at the same speed no matter what I did. (It\\'s cheap to use used parts, but the result may be other than expected.) When I get home today, I\\'ll try building a simple H-Bridge using 4 transistors and 4 resistors. This will drive one motor up to 50mA, and is more than enough for me. If I get that working, I\\'ll try different things for interfacing a sensor, and thereby hopefully get a motor that turns faster if light hits the sensor. Some of you might say: \"That\\'s so simple. Can\\'t believe he\\'s having problems with that.\" Well, I have no education on the field of electronics, so the things I do know, I have taught myself. Will write tomorrow informing you of the result after tonights test.',\n",
       " \"Hmm, time seems to just fly by. I've found a tutorial I think will help me greatly. It's a written article in the norwegian edition of LinuxMagazine, called LinuxSchool. This article is written in norwegian, but I'll soon mail the author, and ask if I can translate it to english. If -/ and when it's done, I'll post it on my site, and write about it here. The article covers setup of DNS, Mail, News, SSH and a few things more I don't remember right now. It bases on a real live example-domain, and that's exactly what I was looking for. I'm hoping to achieve the following, based on the fact I only have a dialup: One machine acting as Router/Gateway and firewall.  Another server handling all this other stuff. When connected to the internett, it'll retrieve all mail from my online hosts, and I can then read it all later, offline. It will act as my DNS server, asking the DNS' of my ISP for the info first. (Caching) I'm not sure about news yet, but I'll probably try it out. More about this will be on my web-site.\",\n",
       " \"I've had so much work lately that robotics has gone on hold. Not for long but some time. I registered a new domain just the other day.  urlLink www.linuxboxonline.net  I'm working on a new site, and as you might imagine, it will be about Linux. All the while I'm trying to teach myself Linux, and how to set up a server. This server will host preferably: DNS, DHCP, Mail, Web, News... I need to find a place to put the server, because I just checked with our supplier, and I live 150meters to far from the junction box. No DSL available. That's a bi**h. Anyway, I hope to get this working soon. Testing out on my home network first. Using Slackware 9.0 with standard 2.4.20 kernel. I'll have to upgrade to 2.6 kernel. Just have to learn how to do that first. If anyone reads this, and knows of a good tutorial online, or a book... Be my guest and  urlLink mail me\",\n",
       " \"Another weekend gone, and a few beers was consumed. That resulted in nothing much done at all. I have never the less designed a new site and put it out:  urlLink linuxboxonline.net  Only the design is there. Haven't put up any other pages yet. They will come, well over half the work is done now. Only have to create the individual pages. It's summer so among work, chores and random stuff, the time to do robotics and maintain sites is getting smaller and smaller. The latest stuff now has been painting the house. Not done in a day. A week, maybe. Anyway, the design is there. Haven't even had a chance to test a server config yet. If the rain continues, I might get a chance to test tonight. We'll see. Test results will be made available at my site. I've found yet another tutorial available. This one shows how to setup a WEB-Hotel with a few domains. That might help me. Written in Norwegian, but I might find the time to translate it, If the author allows me.\",\n",
       " \"My server is up and running (not online though) with DNS, WEB, web-hosting services, SSH, FTP. That's all I can remember now. Been trying to config Sendmail now, but having no luck. Just won't work. I have planned a reinstall of slackware during the weekend, and I think I will upgrade from 9.0 to 9.1 or maybe 10.0 if I can download it. I just got a tip to try using Postfix instead.. Should be heaps easier to config and get up and running. Have to try that over the weekend... I'll be thrilled if I get it up and running. Been thinking of a server like this for ages. Thanks to all the people on #slackware who has helped me, and all the people taking the time to write tutorials for us newbies out there. When I get a little more elite, I'll write a few tuts myself. Both in Norwegian (my native tongue) and English.\",\n",
       " \"Finally. I've had a chance to play with my server, and I've connected a small network at home. Late saturday night, I reinstalled Slackware 9.0 with only the bare essentials, and I started playing with DNS (BIND) and apache. I've set up apache before, so that wasn't the problem. Getting BIND to run, and VirtualHosts in apache was the pain. However some reading of a few norwegian tutorials, I fell back to a tutorial at  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com   urlLink Chapter 6  is the exact location. This tutorial was great reading when I allready had read about DNS. If you've played with linux for a short while, and know the basics, this is the best tut I've found out there. They also have a lot more tuts on their site. The HOWTO and  urlLink tldp.org  written by Nicolai Langefeldt was to long, and contained much more info than what was really needed. That was only confusing. After fixing a few typos in the config files, BIND started and played like a charm. I changed httpd.conf to match my server name and other basic things. The next step was VirtualHosting. Everything was so simple when the basics was there. Now I have two domains running on my server. I'm not online with the server yet, but that will come. The next challenge is getting e-mail up and running for the domains. I'm using the Sendmail chapter from  urlLink linuxhomenetworking.com  Hope toget it all working soon.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve revived a hobby of mine that I haven\\'t cultivated for some time now. Photography.. I\\'ve even put up a section on my website  urlLink www.linuxboxonline.net  about photo. My linux-server at home is now awaiting my upgradeing to Slackware 10.0, but that might be a while. I find less and less time to \"fiddle\" with my server. I did manage to get some time to take photos the night before last. Nothing spectacular, but I hope I managed to cature the lightning-flash I encountered. If I did, I\\'ll post it in my gallery when I get that up and running. I also post to  urlLink www.foto.no  and  urlLink www.photo.net  when I have pictures I\\'d like to have others view.',\n",

       " \"Hey everyone! I'm back from our family trip to San Antonio and it was a blast. We got there later in the day on Friday, rested a little bit, then went down to the river walk. We walked down one side, crossed over, then ate at an Italian place. It was my sisters b-day and the brought her Cheesecake and our waiter sang to her. We toured around some more then walked back to our room in the Taj Mahal. OK, we stayed in the Hampton Inn- small room, 2 very small beds, and no closet- It was fun trying to get ready with 3 other people. My dad and I went to Sea World at 6 in the morning. I rode Steel Eel about 10 times and Great White about 5. We went back downtown and picked the girls up, drove back to Sea World. We spent the rest of the day walking around and watching shows. We took the girls back to the hotel and my dad and I went to Fiesta Texas for some Exclusive Ride Time on Poltergeist and Scream! We had a great ride op named Gina that had a lot of fun with us and was very popular. Back to hotel. My sister had gone out with some friends that live in San Antonio and ended staying the night there. Mi Padre and I went back to SFFT at around 6am the next day (Sunday) and rode Superman:Krypton Coaster first thing for ERT. We then went on the cliff-top tour. This was a unique experience and very privledged. We watched SKC up on the cliff then went to where they fire off the fireworks for the Lone Star Spectacular. David Blazer (our escort and tour guide for the weekend) told us how most employees are not allowed on the cliff and neither is security- we were very privledged to go up there.  More on David- he is the director of entertainment and is the responsible for getting the park the 5 Golden Tickets for Best Entertainment. He was very knowledgeable and gave us great hospitality. He escorted us around both days and gave us a lot of great information. Back to the trip report- After the tour we went to Armadillo Beach (the waterpark) for ERT on the newest ride- TORNADO. It is a huge ride and is very intense for a waterpark ride. The group broke up and my dad and I spent some time in the park. We ate lunch at a group reservation place and had a great lunch on silverware and tablecloths. The General Manager and director of ride operations ate lunch with my dad and I had so much fun. They told us a lot about their jobs and what to expect in the coming months from the park. They also told my dad and I some stuff I'm not allowed to tell anyone else- yes, there is A LOT of room where Joker's Revene used to be. I'll leave it at that. We then spent more time in the park. It was very hot, so we watched some shows. We watched the Lone Star Spectacular and stayed in the ampitheater while security cleared the park. We proceeded to Rattler and got one ride in, then it broke down, so everyone headed to Road Runner Express. I love this ride. It is a little short but is quite intense for it's size. I must have ridden it at least 15 or 20 times in a row. I also want to mention that Gina, our ride op from the night before, said she had so much fun with us from the night before she came back again. She guest spieled on RoadRunner and took a few rides next to me. It was a great night. We headed back for the hotel and went sleepy. On monday we packed up and went home. boring day.  This was a great trip!\",\n",
       " u\"THE RACE BEGINS - THE 76TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS   At the KODAK THEATER, Hollywood and Highland - California   Sunday February 29th, 2004     PREDICTIONS IN THE MAJOR CATEGORIES by Rex A Okpodu     Updated February 23rd, 2004 ----------------------------------   BEST PICTURE  THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING (New Line Cinema)   Golden Globe Winner, Best Picture\\u2014Drama  Best Ensemble winner, Screen Actors Guild 2003  This, of course, is the conclusion to the epic Tolkien fantasy trilogy about the quest for the ring.   This is the favorite to win.  Reasons for: It is overdue for a win, since it has two previous consecutive Best Picture nominations for the prequels\\u2014The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.   The trilogy has amassed 30 nominations (11 this time around) and 6 wins since 2001.   The winner of the Directors Guild of America(DGA) award usually wins best picture(see: director category below)  Reasons against: With so much riding on this conclusion to the already commercially successful trilogy, has it actually been worth the wait? The consensus seems to be resoundingly positive. But will the academy honor a fantasy film? It never has before, despite nominations for Star Wars (1977) and E.T.(1982). What\\u2019s more, Academy voters might resent their hands being forced by a sense of obligation.   MYSTIC RIVER (Warner Bros.)    This is the closest competitor to The Return of the King. It is a drama about childhood friends reunited by the murder of one of their children.   Reasons for: It is turning out to be this year's critical champion, with a slew of citations from reviewers. Older members of the academy have been being buzzing about it being a gritty drama in the same league with films like A Streetcar Named Desire. It is Clint Eastwood's best work since Unforgiven and it has a terrific cast in Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, and Marcia Gay Harden.  Reasons against: Like In the Bedroom (2001), it might be too dark for the more mainstream academy voters. Also, Warner Bros. is not very good at Oscar campaigns.    SEABISCUIT (Universal/DreamWorks)   Reasons for: It is a summer box-office champ that has sold extremely well since its recent release on DVD.  Reasons against: Its Best Picture nomination might be viewed as sufficient reward.   MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD (Universal/Fox/Miramax)   This stirring action-adventure picture is about the strangeness of life on the far side of the world, set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars.  Reasons for: This film has the backing of three Studios (Fox, Miramax, and Universal) which means a lot of industry votes and support. Despite his offscreen reputation, the academy loves Crowe, who has a history of powering a good film to multiple nominations\\u2014The Insider, Gladiator, and  A Beautiful Mind in recent years. Also, epic, male-driven films do well at the Academy.   Reasons against: If people want an epic, they\\u2019ll probably vote for The Return of the King. Finally, seagoing films do not often do well with the academy (Titanic was an exception.)    LOST IN TRANSLATION (Focus Features)  Reasons for: It might benefit if the academy decides to reward a comedy as Best Picture. It has a boost boost from critics around the nation. It would probably fare better here if it had been directed by a man.    BEST DIRECTOR   PETER JACKSON, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King   Golden Globe Winner, Best Director  Directors Guild of America, Winner at his third consecutive nomination.  After one failed Best Director nomination in 2001 and a snub in 2002, Jackson is a major contender for a win with this final installment of the hobbit story.   Reasons for:Won best director at the Directors Guild of America dinner 2004. The DGA winner has matched the Oscar winner for best director and picture ninety percent of the time since it's inception in 1948  The exceptions were in: 1948 Joseph L. Mankiewicz(A Letter to Three Wives) - DGA         John Huston(Treasure of Sierra Madre) - Oscar(director)         Hamlet - best picture 1968 Anthony Harvey(Lion in Winter) - DGA         Carol Reed(Oliver) - Oscars(director and picture) 1995 Ron Howard(Apollo 13) - DGA         Mel Gibson(Braveheart) - Oscars (director and picture) 2000 Ang Lee(Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) - DGA         Steven Soderbergh(Traffic) - Oscar (director)         Gladiator - best picture) 2002 Rob Marshall(Chicago) - DGA         Roman Polanski(The Pianist) - Oscar          Chicago - picture  There is widespread agreement that he has completed a mammoth task and made a classic. In addition, the trilogy has been a tremendous money-spinner for the industry.   Reasons against: His newfound commercial success (he is getting $20 million for his next project, King Kong) might be viewed as adequate reward. And he is still a Hollywood outsider.  PETER WEIR, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World    Reasons for: He is a consistently good director and four-time previous nominee in this category forWitness (1985), Dead Poets Society (1989), Green Card (1990), and The Truman Show (1998). He is long overdue for a win, and this could be his year.  Recently won the BAFTA and like last year's win by Roman Polanski,could be the start of a momentum  Reason against: Academy voters always resent that sense of obligation to an overdue director.  This year belongs to Peter Jackson and ROTK   CLINT EASTWOOD, Mystic River    Reasons for: There is widespread agreement that this is Eastwood\\u2019s best work since Unforgiven (1992). He is a Hollywood player with tremendous clout and star power.   Reasons against: He has already been rewarded amply by the academy. A few people are turned off by the film's dark material. The academy might want to reward newer talent or someone overdue for the award.(see Peter Jackson - above)  SOFIA COPPOLA, Lost in Translation    Reasons for: The film garnered very good reviews and could be rewarded in this category, though Coppola\\u2019s much more likely to be honored with a screenplay statuette. She is a member of a well-connected filmmaking family\\u2014her father is Francis Ford Coppola. This is only the third nomination for a woman in this category in 76 years\\u2014Lina Wertmuller (Seven Beauties, 1976) and Jane Campion (The Piano, 1994) are the others.  Reasons against: The academy has a gender bias in this category. And despite widespread rave reviews.   FERNANDO MEIRELLES, City of God  Reason for: This film, bringing the first nomination for this Brazilian director, has been acclaimed worldwide.  Reason against: The movie does not have the added bonus of being nominated in the foreign-language category, as is usual with similar recent examples in this category, such as Life Is Beautiful (1998) or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, (2000), both of which won in the foreign-language  category.  BEST ACTOR  SEAN PENN, Mystic River   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actor\\u2014Drama   Reasons for: This is turning out to be the Year of Penn. With two critically acclaimed films in his favor (21 Grams is the other, an AA win is a very strong possibility. And with three previous nominations in this category\\u2014Dead Man Walking (1995), Sweet and Lowdown (1999), and I Am Sam (2001), he is overdue for a win.   Reasons against: His outspoken antiwar campaign could bring him some unwelcome backlash. His volatile nature could be his undoing during Oscar campaign time. He is unlikely to want to be seen as eager for academy recognition, which could alienate some. His surprise loss  at the SAGs might indicate a loss of momentum Him not showing up at the Golden Globes did not help.  BEN KINGSLEY, House of Sand and Fog    Reasons for: Has got major buzz about his performance in this film. He may be due for another Oscar after two previous nominations in the supporting category for Bugsy (1991) and Sexy Beast (2001), with a win for the lead role in Gandhi (1982).   Reasons against: Without a major push, this movie may be squeezed out. What\\u2019s more, it doesn\\u2019t have big box office.   BILL MURRAY, Lost in Translation  Golden Globe Winner, Best Actor\\u2014Musical or Comedy   Reasons for: He has won many critics\\u2019 awards. He was overlooked for Rushmore (1999). His performance at the podium for his Golden Globe win was impressive and delightful.  Reasons against: Despite the raves, the academy does not go for this kind of deadpan comic performance(at least the older members do not).  Like Penn(above),was considered a shoo-in at the SAGs and his loss here might indicate a last minute loss of momentum.  JOHNNY DEPP, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl   SAG Winner, Best Actor  Reasons for: He got raves and the movie was a huge hit in both the theaters and on DVD. His surprise victory at the SAGs indicates widespread support by the Acting branch who also make up the largest group at AMPAS.  Reasons against:Despite the SAG award,the year probably belongs to Penn or Murray  JUDE LAW, Cold Mountain  Reasons for: He is a former Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actor in The Talented Mr. Ripley. He managed to make the big five despite the poor overall showing by Cold Mountain.  Reason against: He was a big-name SAG omission.  BEST ACTRESS  CHARLIZE THERON, Monster   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actress\\u2014Drama  SAG Winner, Best Actress  Reasons for: The unstoppable frontrunner in this category - as indicated by wins at the Golden Globes and SAGs. She has the kind of role the academy likes in this biopic about a prostitute who was an executed murderess. Finally, as the past two winners in this category have shown, the academy absolutely adores women who play deglammed parts and who look great on the red carpet.   DIANE KEATON, Something's Gotta Give   Golden Globe Winner, Best Actress\\u2014Musical or Comedy   Reasons for: She is a beloved Hollywood veteran who is a previous Oscar winner for Annie Hall (1977). This comedy about older characters should should play very well with older members of the academy. She is the sole American nominee in a lineup of foreigners and every time that happened in the past 75 years,the American won (exception - 1998, Judi Dench won best supporting actress in an all foreigner lineup in which Kathy Bates(Primary Colors) was the only American)   Reason against: Like Sissy Spicek in 2001,the earlier momentum has vanished post - Golden Globes Keaton\\u2019s previous win is one of only five instances\\u2014the others being Glenda Jackson forA Touch of Class (1973), Cher for Moonstruck (1987), Helen Hunt for As Good as it Gets (1997), and Gwyneth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love (1998)\\u2014of an actress winning in this category for a romantic comedy over the past four decades.   NAOMI WATTS, 21 Grams    Reasons for: She plays a flashy, Oscar-bait role in this gritty drama. She has rebounded from the setback of her noninclusion by the Golden Globes by taking the Los Angeles Film Critics\\u2019 Best Actress and scoring a nomination at the SAGs.  Reasons against: The dark nature of the film and the current restriction on screeners.  KEISHA CASTLE-HUGHES, Whale Rider   Reason for: Her inclusion at the SAGs indicates strong support for her title-role performance.  Reason against: At 13, she is currently the youngest ever nominee in this category since Isabel Adjani was a nominee at 20 for The Story of Adele H(1975)  Very young nominees tend to win in supporting category. Recent examples are Tatum O'neal(10) Paper Moon(1973) and Anna Paquin(11) The Piano(1993)   SAMANTHA MORTON, In America  Reason for: The strong showing of In America in three major categories suggests widespread support for this former Oscar nominee for Best Supporting Actress for 1999\\u2019s Sweet and Lowdown.  Reason against: Not enough people have seen the film.   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR  TIM ROBBINS, Mystic River  Golden Globe Winner, Best Supporting Actor  SAG Winner, Best Supporting Actor  Reasons for: The film's multiple nominations in major categories are a help. Plus the academy likes versatility\\u2014he has a previous directing nomination and even directed a win for his partner, Susan Sarandon, for Dead Man Walking (1995).   Reason against: His political views, although he gave a straightforward acceptance speech at the Golden Globes.   KEN WATANABE, The Last Samurai    Reason for: His strong, sexy performance.  Reason against: Aside from three technical award nominations, he is the sole beneficiary in a poor showing by this film.  ALEC BALDWIN, The Cooler   Reasons for: With his critics\\u2019 organization wins, he could be the dark horse in this category.  Reasons against: Not enough people have seen the film. His bullying history with ex-wife Kim Basinger doesn\\u2019t help.  BENICIO DEL TORO, 21 Grams   Reason for: As with costar Watts, the SAGs have revived his campaign, as it indicates good support for this film by the actors\\u2019 branch, which has many votes in the academy.  Reason against: He\\u2019s recently won an Oscar, for Traffic (2000).  DJIMON HOUNSOU, In America   Reason for: He plays an Oscar-bait role (a man with AIDS) in a film that has done very well at professional guild screenings..  Reason against:  He has a very low media profile for an Oscar nominee and not being a Golden Globe or SAG nominee did not help.  BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS  RENEE ZELLWEGER, Cold Mountain  Golden Globe Winner, Best Supporting Actress  SAG Winner, Best Supporting Actress  Reason for: Another Oscar chance (this will be her third in a row\\u2014in supporting category this time) for this nominee to get her overdue Oscar. The first SAG consecutive winner, 2003 - best actress (for Chicago) and 2004 - best supporting actress(for Cold Mountain)  Reason against: The usual anticipated backlash against Miramax, plus the movie did not do well in Oscar noms.  HOLLY HUNTER, Thirteen   Reason for: A good offering from a seasoned actress, who is an Oscar winner (The Piano) and three-time nominee. She is a favorite on the indie circuit.  Reason against: Will older/nonindie members of the academy bother to go see this movie?   PATRICIA CLARKSON, Pieces of April   Reasons for: East Coast indie-circuit queen has had a good year with this movie and The Station Agent.She may benefit from appearing on several critics\\u2019 lists nationwide. A double nomination at the SAGs shows momentum.  Reason against: Will enough people have actually seen this film?  MARCIA GAY HARDEN, Mystic River   Reasons for: Fresh from her Oscar success in Pollock (2001), she delivers a tour de force performance in the biggest female role in Eastwood's critically acclaimed drama. She would definitely benefit if there is a sweep by the film.   Reasons against: Her female role might get overlooked in this male-driven drama. Plus the academy might feel she has too recently been in the winners circle.  SHOHREH AGHDASHLOO, House of Sand and Fog  Reason for: She gave a wrenching performance in this small Oscar-bait role\\u2014she played a long-suffering, dislocated wife who endures family tragedy.   Reason against: Lack of a SAG nomination indicates weak support among the important actors\\u2019 bloc of Oscar voters.

       " 'TUESDAY 27 JANUARY, 2004 - Oscar Nomination Morning -------------------------------------------------------------------- By Rex A. Okpodu Contributing Editor - Out.com  London,United kingdom  Watched the Golden Globes on \"UK Living\" last night at Sandra\\'s(Sange) Was going to stay over but decided to rush back home and prepare for this morning since the Globes finished before midnight. I caught the last but one train from Turnpike lane to Baron\\'s Court...In bed by 1am  Up by 9am this morning.   Got this email from BL(editor,out.com) saying we have to lead the story with something out-related...Charlize Theron(she is due the Oscar nomination for playing a gay(albeit none-sympathetic role) I guess he is right,afterall out.com is no Entertainment Weekly  Went online to set and wait for the live broadcast from abc.com. The announcement comes up at 05.30(PST) i.e 1.30pm(GMT)  Dominic rings to ask me how excited I am?..I am not amused! He seems to be more excited than I am...he thinks I am bottling it all up.... I guess he knows me too well  Michael rings..I ignore his call... I think people are starting to irritate me by all these phonecalls...don\\'t they realise I will like to enjoy the moments before alone?  1.00pm - Nothing seems to be coming up by way of a url for ABC.com Decided to switch to BBC - It looks like the announcement will be live on News 24  Lots going on as the Preamble to the  Hutton Enquiry on the David Kelly suicide is also  being expected  Anna Ford mentions the imminent Oscar nomination on BBC News ... I have my live link up ready...the tv and computer are set to go......  1.28pm - News 24 starts a broadcast - with a link up ready on one of their screens  1.30pm - We are live to Los Angeles as Sigourney Weaver and Frank Pierson start the announcements  I am scribbling frantically even though I know the entire lists will be online in a few minutes.  I am also on the phone to Sange and giving her a live relay   Lots of surprises/shocks/etc 1.45pm - the announcement is over and I go back online for the full list I am amazed at such diversity...City of God for Best Director/Screenplay? Keisha-White for best actress? how come?We all thought the Focus Pictures was campaigning for her in the supporting category...obviously,the Academy thought otherwise since she did play the title/lead role  Later in the Afternoon... I share the news with Michael and then Dominic...a part of me feels anti-climatic now the announcement is over  I start on my blog edits as I have to get the write up to Brendan Lemon(out.com) for publication later today/tomorrow  Evening - started reading all the post nomination debate on the web. The general consensus is that it is the best set of nominations for a long time. While some of the races are  more or less sewn up (Rotk for best picture and director) others have opened...supporting actress,the screenplays,etc   WEDNESDAY 28 JANUARY,2004 ----------------------------------------  My article(with a bit of editing) is now live on out.com albeit in the editor\\'s column...I would have preferred it on my own page but technical difficulties exist preclude from giving that.  More to read online Have to start on updates for feb...post DGA, BAFTA and SAG Came up with this statistic from the web..resulting from this year\\'s acting nominees list....  Europe: Ben Kingsley (UK), Jude Law (UK), Samantha Morton (UK)  Asia: Shohreh Aghdashloo (Iran), Ken Watanabe (Japan)  Africa: Djimon Hounsou (Benin), Charlize Theron (South Africa)  Oceania: Keisha Castle-Hughes (New Zealand), Naomi Watts (Australia)  America: Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Sean Penn, Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Patricia Clarkson, Marcia Gay Harden, Holy Hunter, Renee Zellweger (all from the U.S.A.), Benicio Del Toro (Puerto Rico)  And Races -  Ben Kingsley (half-Indian) Benicio del Toro (Puerto Rican) Djimon Hounson (black West African) Ken Watanabe (Japanese) Keisha Castle-Hughes (half-Maori) Shohreh Aghdashloo (Iranian)   THURSDAY 29 JANUARY,2004 ------------------------------------  More post nomination online reading   FRIDAY 30 JANUARY,2004 --------------------------------  Still catching up with the post nominations online debate...am getting a bit irritated by all the talk about the none nomination of Cold Mountain for best pic or director...we all expected Minghella to be excluded from best director(having not been nominated by the DGA)..so what? Miramax still has the most nominations..still got the multiple nominations for City of God....talk about knocking one down when you have slipped down a bit! Too much is being read into it all...am sure Miramax will be back next year...am also sure the release date affected things a bit more than is being considered?  Sean Penn is now going to the Ceremony on Feb 29th....good for him. It was a bad decision not to sure up for the Golden Globes...giving some lame excuse. Lets hope he has not destroyed his chances already He had better attend,Bafta,or DGA or SAG or even all three and lighten up ..if and when he wins Have to start compiling up the list of films to be seen before the ceremony Viewership...how many have I seen in the major categories?

Jennifer Connelly(oscar winner on the same night as Berry is there as was Salma Hayek(nominee 2003) and  Diane Lane (also nominee 2003) Even Gwyneth Paltrow (best actress 1998) was in the lineup  Furthermore,everyone knew Ampas was moving up the nominations by a month...why did VF not add the information about this year\\'s GG and Oscar nominees before going to print?...shameful!!!! I will be writing to them and to various online sites about this  Screening 21 Grams alone this evening...in between making dinner and doing this diary  DGA - tomorrow..saturday  Preview email/update to BL stats - DGA matches Oscar from 1949 -1967 and 1969 - 1999 Note  1948 (Joseph L.

Each time I read my VF..am still annoyed at the lack of updated texts Recording Angels in America(the award winning HBO film) for Sange who is away skiing in Switzerland  Before bedtime...having a glimpse at what we are to expect for Oscar 77(2005) Watching The Hours(2002) - winner of 1 Oscar - Best Actress at the 75th Academy Awards  SUNDAY 8 FEBRUARY, 2004 ------------------------------ Post DGA - as expected peter Jackson(ROTK) won... Penn did attend...as well as sevaral others Sent in updates to BL at out.com Watched Smallville with DK at brunch Had drinks with a friend ...who happens to be the designer Julian Macdonald..he tells me confidentially,  Liv Tyler will be wearing one of his(Givenchy) dresses and doing a major presentation at the Oscars(29th Feb) - I guess - introducing the clip for ROTK? Recording the last part of Angels in America More - The Hours..before bed tonight  MONDAY 9th -------------------------------- Started viewing the weekend recording of Angels in America BL accepted updates but we will only be having one for out.com post-SAG on the 22nd(one week before d-day)  TUESDAY 10th ------------------ Yet to finish AIA....really enjoyable.  Oscar.org released the pics from Monday\\'s luncheon...Sean Penn attended with his mother(good for him and his campaign)  BL tells me he(Sean Penn) has been sounding off about Iraq again..story was not widely reported, so he is might still be safe from a backlash!   10.30pm Just got back from a screening of a Brazillian film  at the BCA in London with Dom and Carlos -  Deus e Brasileiro(God is Brazillian)..Nice to look at,had it\\'s moments but did not quite take off  Finished the last part of AIA finally..thn watched live from the red carpet at the Golden Globes with Joan Rivers(the mop) and her daughter,Melissa...Nicole Kidman looked and sounded awful..she is beginning to take herself too seriously(in my opinion)  WEDNESDAY 11TH -----------------------  11pm  Saw \"Something\\'s Gotta Give\"(Best Actress Nominee - 76th Academy Awards) with  Sange...was witty,well styled and enjoyable but why do hollywood movies have to tie up everything with a bow right to the very end..leaving nothing to the imagination? Is it for the aaah! factor?..fairy tale endings and all that...it would have been a much better and more realistic movie had it ended with Jack walking down alone on the Seine and regretting what might have been...sort of like real life...... And did we really have to see them all living happily ever after with their grandchild and all that?  More  - The Hours...tonight  THURSDAY 12TH --------------------- Catching up with reading matter from the web about Oscar 76 Sent out various emails updating fellow enthusiasts with word  on - the above A rant-email sent about the current VF issue which Nathaniel(the film experience) says is \"adoring\" Did he get the same issue as me?

       " u'OSCAR SPECULATION SITE...... THE ROAD TO OSCAR...THE 77TH ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS    August 7, 2004  \\xa0 Rex A. Okpodu Contributing Editor,  Out.com     Best Picture - Five possibilities from the following:  The Aviator (Warner Bros./Miramax) Alexander (Warner Bros.) J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland (Miramax) The Phantom of the Opera (Warner Bros.) Collateral (Dreamworks) Closer (Columbia) A Very Long Engagement (WB) The Passion of the Christ (Newmarket) Spanglish (Columbia) \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" (Miramax/Lion\\'s Gate)    Martin Scorsese\\'s The Aviator emerges as the early favorite for at least a nomination and or win despite the fact that the Academy has snubbed him four times previously (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and Gangs of New York ).   Oliver Stone\\'s Alexander - Another 2004 Warner Brothers production with Oscar predigree and could be WB\\'s  option since Troy failed to live up to expectations  J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland will be a critical darling, following in the footsteps of director Marc Foster\\'s last film, Monster\\'s Ball.   The musical/comedy spot is between Disney\\'s The Last Shot, with rookie director Jeff Nathanson at the helm and Joel Shumacher\\'s The Phantom of the Opera.  Taking over a 100 million at the box office(a record for a documentary) and general critical support, F 9/11 might be pushed in this as well as the documentary category especially if it starts appearing on several Critics Best Picture lists in the Fall   Best Director - Five possibilities from the following:  Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) Marc Foster (J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland) Mel Gibson (The Passion of the Christ) Jeff Nathanson (The Last Shot) Michael Mann (Collateral) Mike Nichols (Closer) Oliver Stone  (Alexander) Mira Nair (Vanity Fair) John Madden (Proof)   The Academy usually awards best director nominations to the Best Picture nominees, with the argument that if a movie is good enough to be nominated for Best Picture it has to be well directed. However, there is always one film that gets nominated that isn\\'t a Best Picture nominee, and one suspects that it might be Mel Gibson for The Passion of the Christ.   Best Actor - Five possibilities from the following:  Jeff Bridges (Door in the Floor) Jim Carrey (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) Leonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator) Colin Farrell (Alexander) Denzel Washington (The Manchurian Candidate) Johnny Depp (J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland) James Caviezel (The Passion of the Christ) Tom Cruise (Collateral) Liam Neeson (Kinsey) Bill Murray (The Life Aquatic) Jamie Foxx (Ray)  With rave reviews for this role and being long overdue for a win, Jeff Bridges is the current frontrunner  Leonardo DiCaprio might get his first best actor nomination, after getting snubbed for Titanic and Gangs of New York.   Collin Farrell (Hollywood\\'s up and coming enfant terrible) has been on the radar since Tigerland(2000) and this film with it\\'s bisexual overtones from Oliver Stone could get the gay friendly vote and lead to a nomination  Johnny Depp showed his popularity after his light role with Pirates of the Carribean led to a nomination last year, and his dramatic turn in this film could see him back again in Neverland   Tom Cruise was snubbed last year and could return this year especially as this is a Michael Mann film where TC is acting against type (same as his last nomination for Magnolia in 1999)  Kevin Kline\\'s portrayal of Cole Porter\\'s marriage is sort of gay without being too gay and is the kind of film palatable to the Academy\\'s taste especially it gets several critics nods    Best Actress - Five possibilities from the following:  Anne Reid (Mother)  Robin Wright Penn (A Home At The End of the World) Kate Wnslet (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) Gwyneth Paltrow (Proof) Emily Rosum (The Phantom of the Opera) Nicole Kidman (Birth) Reese Witherspoon  (Walk the Line) Cate Blanchett (The Life Acquatic) Joan Allen (The Upside of Anger) Annette Benning (Being Julia) Catalina Sandino Moreno (Maria Full of Grace) Andrey Tatou (A Very Long Engagement)    Anne Reid is an early frontrunner with the critics and might get the Academy\\'s nod at nomination time  Robin Wright Penn makes the vote for a gay - friendly film also starring Colin Farrell. The Academy likes married couples in its circle especially since Sean won this year and might be presenting the award next year  Nicole Kidman\\'s problem Oscarwise is that she has many film roles but not all of them any good.She is a recent winner, was snubbed this year but might get a nomination next year if the film gets outstanding critical or box office recognition  Joan Allen is an overdue actress and could get in if the film or her acting role is well received  Annette Benning is another actress overdue for an Oscar and could be in the running  again this year  Reese Witherspoon, for the Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line, and Emily Rosum for The Phantom of the Opera, might get in a round up an uncharacteristically weak Best Actress category.   Best Supporting Actor - Five possibilities from the following:  Peter O\\'Toole (Troy) Jude Law (The Aviator) Alec Baldwin (The Last Shot) Patrick Wilson (The Phantom of the Opera) Anthony Hopkins (Alexander) Gary Oldman (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) Dustin Hoffman (J. M. Barrie\\'s Neverland) Morgan Freeman (An Unfinished Life) Jim Broadbent (Vanity Fair) Jamie Foxx (Collateral) David Carradine (Kill Bill II)  Jude Law is the early favorite for The Aviator.  Peter O\\'Toole and Anthony Hopkins stake claim for the older generation of actors.   Newcomer, Patrick Wilson has an important role in The Phantom of the Opera.  Alec Baldwin\\'s nomination for The Cooler could help him get nominated for The Last Shot but do not discount Gary Oldman for  the blockburster sequel, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban   Best Supporting Actress - Five possibilities from the following:  Irma P. Hall  (The Ladykillers) Kate Winslet  (J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland) Angelina Jolie  (Alexander) Toni Collete  (The Last Shot) Monica Belluci (The Passion of the Christ) Cate Blanchett  (The Aviator) Glenn Close (The Stepford Wives) Sissy Spicek (A Home At The End of the World) Natalie Portman (Closer or Garden State) Meryl Streep (The Manchurian Candidate)  Irma P. Hall won this year\\'s Jury prize (Acting) at the Cannes Film Festival for The LadyKillers (directed by the Coen Brothers) and might make the Academy shortlist next year   The Academy loved Katherine Hepburn and they might love Blanchett\\'s portrayal equally well.   Kate Winslet hasn\\'t gotten much love since Titanic, but critics should love her in Neverland.   Monica Belluci had a powerful role as Mary Magdelene in The Passion of the Christ.   Toni Collete has been nominated for The Sixth Sense and could get another for The Last Shot.  After a string of unremarkable roles since 1999\\'s win for Girl, Interrupted, Angelina Jolie, could be back with another nomination for her role in Alexander   Best Original Screenplay  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Aviator  J.M. Barrie\\'s Neverland  The Last Shot The Village The Life Acquatic The Terminal   Unlike last year, which was dominated by Adapted Screenplays, 2004 should be dominated by the Original Screenplay category. Best Picture frontrunner, The Aviator is the favorite here as well.   Best Adapted Screenplay  Spanglish The Passion of the Christ The Phantom of the Opera An Unfinished Life Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Polar Express The Notebook  In an unusually weak Adapted Screeplay category, Troy, The Passion of the Christ, and The Phantom of the Opera all are early favorites. The writing of Prizoner of Azkaban is much better than the first two films, so expect it to be a player.   Best Animated Film  Shrek 2  The Polar Express The Incredibles Shark Tale Home on the Range   The inclusion of the Best Animated Film category has increased the number of animated films being made.  The first Shrek movie won the first Animated feature film Oscar given for 2001 Shrek 2 has the reviews and box office success to be the first sequel to win not only a nomination, but a possible win in this category   Best Documentary feature category   \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" (directed by Michael Moore) Winner of the coveted Palme d\\'Or at the Festival making it the first documentary to win this prestigious award since Jacques Cousteau\\'s \"The Silent World\" in 1956 Released to critical and box office acclaim in this election year, F9/11 is the first documentary to gross over 100 million Stateside and might even be a contender in the Best Picture category.  The Hunting of the President (directed by Nickolas Parry and Harry Thomason) - Documentary portrayal of the ten year alleged right wing conspiracy against the Clinton Presidency.  The Corporation (directed by Jennifer Abbott and  Mark Achbar) - A Documentary showing the rise and domination of the Corporation in today\\'s capitalist America    OTHER FILMS TO WATCH OUT FOR (Assuming they meet the AMPAS deadline criteria)  From Cannes 04   The Life and death of Peter Sellers (directed by Stephen Hopkins) - Best Actor   The Motorcycle Diaries (directed Walter Salles) - Any nomination especially Director, Actor and Screenplay  Bad Education (directed by Pedro Almodovar) - Original Screenplay, Director or any of the Acting categories  Clean (directed by Olivier Assayas) - Best Actress winner at the Festival',\n",

For instance - the use of scratched newsreel indicating age/realistic look.  The innovative use of experimental cinematography,long shots,lights,handheld camera work, special use of light for the clear focus of fore and back ground shots during the entire film  Citizen Kane was one of the first film\\'s to use innovative special effects which was very ground breaking and very far advanced for it\\'s time   Most of the actors were from Welle\\'s New York Mercury theater and were first time film actors    THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962) DVD viewed May 7 - 10  Directed by John Frankenheimer  Nominated for 2 Academy Awards - Best Supporting Actress and Best Film Editing  Won - None  Brief Notes on DVD/Special Features  Decided to watch this one more time before the 2004 release of the remake starring Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington as directed by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner for best director from the multi Oscar winning film, The Silence of the Lambs -1991)  Original,chilling and full of suspense.

       " \"THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH (1952)  Directed by Cecil B. DeMille  Nominated for 5 Academy Awards  Won 2 - Best Picture and Best Writing, Motion Picture Story   In my opinion,this is one of those times when the Academy's choice for the year does not hold up. How SHOW could have picked up Best Picture over HIGH NOON (nominated in 7 categories including Best Picture) is anyone's guess  It is possible that the Studio System (was coming into it's climax in the early 1950s) helped Cecil B. DeMille's pet project prevail over the others  My opinion is that it was a safe family movie about art and work that touched a 1950s nerve. It was certainly less controversial than HIGH NOON which had the McCarthysim subtext and was had it's screenplay adapted by Carl Foreman (one of the blacklisted members of the Hollywood community)  Special Features - None\",\n",

DVD Special Features - Documentary profile of the Red Shoes including interviews with renowned Cinematographer, Jack Cardiff - Recipient of the Honorary Academy Award(2000)  Considered a daring lift for the Post WW2 cinema era.  Innovative technic used has often been cited by contemporary filmmakers such as Spielberg,Coppola and Scorcese as having a strong on their work  Was not well received at first due to it's dark content. Ballet was regarded at an aspirational art form not suited to be dealt with in such a shocking and tragic way as shown by TRS. Even the tragic accident at the end of the film - the vivid imagery of the bloodied stockings by our heroine was considered too shocking for young viewers.\",\n",

It starts with common navigation tools for 2D GIS: zooming, panning, zooming to extent and than it adds the 3rd dimension. It also discusses the way you can handle that extra dimension with a 2D input device. In the 3rd dimension it has pan, zoom and rotate, not sure if I want zoom though. I have to try what use it has. As such the zoom to extent might not be needed either. Interesting extra features is a small window that shows you where you are and what direction you are looking to. Also another classic GIS thing is picking an object to select it and gain access to the information in the database, using a specific colour for the selected object, might be interesting.  The big difference between that application and my muppet is that my application is more a VR and less a GIS, where one wanders through. As such I doubt that you need to get a full overview, a map and maybe that little window should be enough.  other idea: For the sake of discussions it might be useful to add the option to create a snapshot of the current view.',\n",

Interesting thing, especially since I still lack dual head card:  urlLink combining two computers to one desktop .   Since the main object of my research is to add multi-user support to 3D GIS, I'm trying to find a way to visualize threaded discussions in a 3D world. Currently I'm thinking of virtual coloured postits, the actual text is on a website accompanying the 3D world.  The reactions on a postit will put behind the postit. So in a glance you can see where lively discussion are happening. the colours are red = negative comment, green = possitive comment and yellow = other.  selecting a postit will show the text on the site, within it's context. Selecting a topic from the site will transport you to the location of the discussion  ps. if you wonder why the minst.net site is all weird, it's because of an art project which I helped organising and it is going to be on display soon at the  urlLink local library  and this is the website which accompanies that project.\",\n",
       " \"auto sync directories  Having loads of data on different computers which should be available on all those computers; a certain auto-sync directory structure would be nice.  I have daily backup scripts, but it would be nicer if they just keep everything uptodate all the time. Mainly because I don't have to worry about what version is saved where when moving between computers during a day.\",\n",
       " \"ADSL -continued  You might have noticed that there hasn't been much news on the adsl. Good news and bad news about it. Good news is the university pays for setup costs, including cables, so a good reason to ditch the old coax net. The bad news is KPN, the telco, has found a hardwarefailure in one of their magic boxes which distribute telephone traffic, estimated 2, that is  two!! , weeks to fix it. So no internet for me untill februari :(\",\n",
       " \"Job  My supervisor asked to build an application called virtual scan. Basically it produces a 3D world out of a 2d bitmap where each cell is a landuse-type. The trial will be on a 200x200 bitmap, a whopping 40000cells! And each cell wil be put in 3d with 3DS Max models, which can run upto 20Mb each. We decided that somekind of optimalisation might bee useful. Currently we are strugling to get the 3DS models nicely in virtools. The other thing is that I have yet to figure out a way to get the correct value of the cells. Virtools gives some ARGB colour which is of no use to me.  This all means that my thesis is slowed down a bit, not too bad since I've drawn most of the required diagrams on paper already.\",\n",
       " \"Rendering 90square km  Currently working on an application which turns a 2D landuse map to a 3D world. The current test is 90 square km but the final version will be 400 square km. And the level of detail is such that you can walk through it on ground level and it still looks decent. My simple P4 1.7GHz 512MB RAM machine can actually manage it, I can walk through it with slight stuttering. But that could be because I'm running loads of software next to it. Rather promising.\",\n",

I spend the entire day to get around the fact the PHP is serverside and javascript client side, so passing variable around isn't trivial. But I solved the problem at last so the memo is still clickable and now it also gives you the related mesage in the frame next to it :).  I did some minor tweaks as well and cleaned up a bit of code, I do understand the script much more. Today I've tried to get all the memo's loaded during start up. Currently it only creates new memo's but doesn't load existing ones. After a bit of fiddling I came up with an invisible frame to send data between php/MySQL and virtools.
